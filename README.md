Project IV Star Wars - Chewbacca is definitively underrated 

Hello star wars fans and welcome to my fourth project ar Ironhack, 

In today's project, we will do a lot of things namely: 

- Creating and designing the structure of a database
- Writing an API using flask to receive chat database 
- Extracting the emotional value of messages per user/chats and make it queryable through an endpoint

As a starting point, I though let's use Star Wars. Indeed, Star Wars is for sure one of the most famous and popular film within the hacker community. 

In addition to this, the point of this project is to show how underrated Chewbacca is. He is one of the main character of the three films, plays an underrated role and for sure without him the First Order would ruin the universe.
