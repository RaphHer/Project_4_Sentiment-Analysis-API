      "\"228\" \"LUKE\" \"Obi-Wan! Why didn't you tell me?\"\n",
      "\"229\" \"LUKE\" \"You told me Vader betrayed and murdered my father.\"\n",
      "\"230\" \"BEN\" \"You father was seduced by the dark side of the Force. He ceased to be Anakin Skywalker and became Darth Vader. When that happened, the good man who was your father was destroyed. So what I have told you was true... from a certain point of view.\"\n",
      "\"231\" \"LUKE\" \"A certain point of view!\"\n",
      "\"232\" \"BEN\" \"Luke, you're going to find that many of the truths we cling to depend greatly on our own point of view.\"\n",
      "\"233\" \"BEN\" \"I don't blame you for being angry. If I was wrong in what I did, it certainly wouldn't have been for the first time. You see, what happened to your father was my fault.\"\n",
      "\"234\" \"BEN\" \"Anakin was a good friend.\"\n",
      "\"235\" \"BEN\" \"When I first knew him, your father was already a great pilot. But I was amazed how strongly the Force was with him.  I took it upon myself to train him as a Jedi.  I thought that I could instruct him just as well as Yoda.  I was wrong.  My pride has had terrible consequences for the galaxy.\"\n",
      "\"236\" \"LUKE\" \"There's still good in him.\"\n",
      "\"237\" \"BEN\" \"I also thought he could be turned back to the good side. It couldn't be done. He is more machine now than man. Twisted and evil.\"\n",
      "\"238\" \"LUKE\" \"I can't do it, Ben.\"\n",
      "\"239\" \"BEN\" \"You cannot escape your destiny.\"\n",
      "\"240\" \"LUKE\" \"I tried to stop him once. I couldn't do it.\"\n",
      "\"241\" \"BEN\" \"Vader humbled you when first you met him, Luke...but that experience was part of your training. It taught you, among other things, the value of patience.  Had you not been so impatient to defeat Vader then, you could have finished your training here with Yoda. You would have been prepared.\"\n",
      "\"242\" \"LUKE\" \"But I had to help my friends.\"\n",
      "\"243\" \"BEN\" \"And did you help them? It was they who had to save you. You achieved little by rushing back prematurely, I fear.\"\n",
      "\"244\" \"LUKE\" \"I found out Darth Vader was my father.\"\n",
      "\"245\" \"BEN\" \"To be a Jedi, Luke, you must confront and then go beyond the dark side - the side your father couldn't get past. Impatience is the easiest door - for you, like your father. Only, your father was seduced by what he found on the other side of the door, and you have held firm. You're no longer so reckless now, Luke. You are strong and patient. And now, you must face Darth Vader again!\"\n",
      "\"246\" \"LUKE\" \"I can't kill my own father.\"\n",
      "\"247\" \"BEN\" \"Then the Emperor has already won. You were our only hope.\"\n",
      "\"248\" \"LUKE\" \"Yoda spoke of another.\"\n",
      "\"249\" \"BEN\" \"The other he spoke of is your twin sister.\"\n",
      "\"250\" \"LUKE\" \"But I have no sister.\"\n",
      "\"251\" \"BEN\" \"Hmm. To protect you both from the Emperor, you were hidden from your father when you were born. The Emperor knew, as I did, if Anakin were to have any offspring, they would be a threat to him. That is the reason why your sister remains safely anonymous.\"\n",
      "\"252\" \"LUKE\" \"Leia! Leia's my sister.\"\n",
      "\"253\" \"BEN\" \"Your insight serves you well. Bury your feelings deep down, Luke. They do you credit. But they could be made to serve the Emperor.\"\n",
      "\"254\" \"BEN\" \"When your father left, he didn't know your mother was pregnant. Your mother and I knew he would find out eventually, but we wanted to keep you both as safe as possible, for as long as possible.  So I took you to live with my brother Owen on Tatooine... and your mother took Leia to live as the daughter of Senator Organa, on Alderaan.\"\n",
      "\"255\" \"BEN\" \"The Organa household was high-born and politically quite powerful in that system. Leia became a princess by virtue of lineage... no one knew she'd been adopted, of course. But it was a title without real power, since Alderaan had long been a democracy.  Even so, the family continued to be politically powerful, and Leia, following in her foster father's path, became a senator as well.  That's not all she became, of course... she became the leader of her cell in the Alliance against the corrupt Empire. And because she had diplomatic immunity, she was a vital link for getting information to the Rebel cause.  That's what she was doing when her path crossed yours... for her foster parents had always told her to contact me on Tatooine, if her troubles became desperate.\"\n",
      "\"256\" \"LUKE\" \"But you can't let her get involved now, Ben. Vader will destroy her.\"\n",
      "\"257\" \"BEN\" \"She hasn't been trained in the ways of the Jedi the way you have, Luke ... but the Force is strong with her, as it is with all of your family. There is no avoiding the battle. You must face and destroy Vader!\"\n",
      "\"258\" \"HAN\" \"Well, look at you, a general, huh?\"\n",
      "\"259\" \"LANDO\" \"Oh, well, someone must have told them about my little maneuver at the battle of Taanab.\"\n",
      "\"260\" \"HAN\" \"Well, don't look at me, pal. I just said you were a fair pilot. I didn't know they were lookin' for somebody to lead this crazy attack.\"\n",
      "\"261\" \"LANDO\" \"I'm surprised they didn't ask you to do it.\"\n",
      "\"262\" \"HAN\" \"Well, who says they didn't.  But I ain't crazy. You're the respectable one, remember?\"\n",
      "\"263\" \"MON MOTHMA\" \"The Emperor has made a critical error and the time for our attack has come.\"\n",
      "\"264\" \"MON MOTHMA\" \"The data brought to us by the Bothan spies pinpoints the exact location of the Emperor's new battle station. We also know that the weapon systems of this Death Star are not yet operational. With the Imperial Fleet spread throughout the galaxy in a vain effort to engage us, it is relatively unprotected. But most important of all, we've learned that the Emperor himself is personally overseeing the final stages of the construction of this Death Star.\"\n",
      "\"265\" \"MON MOTHMA\" \"Many Bothans died to bring us this information. Admiral Ackbar, please.\"\n",
      "\"266\" \"ACKBAR\" \"You can see here the Death Star orbiting the forest Moon of Endor. Although the weapon systems on this Death Star are not yet operational, the Death Star does have a strong defense mechanism. It is protected by an energy shield, which is generated from the nearby forest Moon of Endor. The shield must be deactivated if any attack is to be attempted. Once the shield is down, our cruisers will create a perimeter, while the fighters fly into the superstructure and attempt to knock out the main reactor.\"\n",

      "\"454\" \"LUKE\" \"You're wrong, Leia. You have that power too. In time you'll learn to use it as I have. The Force is strong in my family. My father has it...I have it...and...my sister has it.\"\n",

      "\"461\" \"LUKE\" \"Because...there is good in him. I've felt it. He won't turn me over to the Emperor. I can save him. I can turn him back to the good side. I have to try.\"\n",

      "\"71\" \"BIGGS\" \"Luke, I didn't come back just to say goodbye...  I shouldn't tell you this, but you're the only one I can trust... and if I don't come back, I want somebody to know.\"\n",
      "\"72\" \"LUKE\" \"What are you talking about?\"\n",
      "\"73\" \"BIGGS\" \"I made some friends at the Academy. ... when our frigate goes to one of the central systems, we're going to jump ship and join the Alliance...\"\n",
      "\"74\" \"LUKE\" \"Join the Rebellion?!  Are you kidding!  How?\"\n",
      "\"75\" \"BIGGS\" \"Quiet down will ya!  You got a mouth bigger than a meteor crater!\"\n",
      "\"76\" \"LUKE\" \"I'm sorry.  I'm quiet. Listen how quiet I am.  You can barely hear me...\"\n",
      "\"77\" \"BIGGS\" \"My friend has a friend on Bestine who might help us make contact.\"\n",
      "\"78\" \"LUKE\" \"around forever trying to find them.\"\n",
      "\"79\" \"BIGGS\" \"I know it's a long shot, but if I don't find them I'll do what I can on my own...  It's what we always talked about.  Luke, I'm not going to wait for the Empire to draft me into service.  The Rebellion is spreading and I want to be on the right side - the side I believe in. \"\n",
      "\"80\" \"LUKE\" \"And I'm stuck here...\"\n",
      "\"81\" \"BIGGS\" \"I thought you were going to the Academy next term.  You'll get your chance to get off this rock.\"\n",
      "\"82\" \"LUKE\" \"Not likely!  I had to cancel my application.  There has been a lot of unrest among the Sand People since you left... they've even raided the outskirts of Anchorhead.\"\n",
      "\"83\" \"BIGGS\" \"Your uncle could hold off a whole colony of Sand People with one blaster.\"\n",
      "\"84\" \"LUKE\" \"I know, but he's got enough vaporators going to make the place pay off.  He needs me for just one more season.  I can't leave him now.\"\n",
      "\"85\" \"BIGGS\" \"I feel for you, Luke, you're going to have to learn what seems to be important or what really is important.  What good is all your uncle's work if it's taken over by the Empire?...  You know they're starting to nationalize commerce in the central systems...it won't be long before your uncle is merely a tenant, slaving for the greater glory of the Empire.\"\n",
      "\"86\" \"LUKE\" \"It couldn't happen here.  You said it yourself.  The Empire won't bother with this rock.\"\n",
      "\"87\" \"BIGGS\" \"Things always change.\"\n",
      "\"88\" \"LUKE\" \"I wish I was going...  Are you going to be around long? \"\n",
      "\"89\" \"BIGGS\" \"No, I'm leaving in the morning...\"\n",
      "\"90\" \"LUKE\" \"Then I guess I won't see you.\"\n",
      "\"91\" \"BIGGS\" \"Maybe someday...  I'll keep a lookout.\"\n",
      "\"92\" \"LUKE\" \"Well, I'll be at the Academy next season... after that who knows.  I won't be drafted into the Imperial Starfleet that's for sure...  Take care of yourself, you'll always be the best friend I've got.\"\n",
      "\"93\" \"BIGGS\" \"So long, Luke.\"\n",
      "\"94\" \"THREEPIO\" \"Artoo-Detoo!  It's you!  It's you!\"\n",
      "\"95\" \"FIRST TROOPER\" \"Someone was in the pod.  The tracks go off in this direction. \"\n",
      "\"96\" \"SECOND TROOPER\" \"Look, sir - droids.\"\n",
      "\"97\" \"THREEPIO\" \"Wake up!  Wake up!\"\n",
      "\"98\" \"THREEPIO\" \"We're doomed.\"\n",
      "\"99\" \"THREEPIO\" \"Do you think they'll melt us down?\"\n",
      "\"100\" \"THREEPIO\" \"Don't shoot!  Don't shoot!  Will this never end?\"\n",
      "\"101\" \"BERU\" \"Luke, tell Owen that if he gets a translator to be sure it speaks Bocce.\"\n",
      "\"102\" \"LUKE\" \"It looks like we don't have much of a choice but I'll remind him.\"\n",
      "\"103\" \"OWEN\" \"I have no need for a protocol droid.\"\n",
      "\"104\" \"THREEPIO\" \"Sir - not in an environment such as this - that's why I've also been programmed for over thirty secondary functions that...\"\n",
      "\"105\" \"OWEN\" \"What I really need is a droid that understands the binary languages of moisture vaporators.\"\n",
      "\"106\" \"THREEPIO\" \"Vaporators!  Sir - My first job was programming binary load lifters... very similar to your vaporators.  You could say...\"\n",
      "\"107\" \"OWEN\" \"Do you speak Bocce?\"\n",
      "\"108\" \"THREEPIO\" \"Of course I can, sir.  It's like a second language for me...  I'm as fluent in Bocce...\"\n",
      "\"109\" \"OWEN\" \"All right; shut up! I'll take this one.\"\n",
      "\"110\" \"THREEPIO\" \"Shutting up, sir.\"\n",
      "\"111\" \"OWEN\" \"Luke, take these two over to the garage, will you?  I want you to have both of them cleaned up before dinner.\"\n",
      "\"112\" \"LUKE\" \"But I was going into Toshi Station to pick up some power converters...\"\n",
      "\"113\" \"OWEN\" \"You can waste time with your friends when your chores are done.  Now, come on, get to it!\"\n",
      "\"114\" \"LUKE\" \"All right, come on!  And the red one, come on.  Well, come on, Red, let's go.\"\n",
      "\"115\" \"LUKE\" \"Uncle Owen...\"\n",
      "\"116\" \"OWEN\" \"Yeah?\"\n",
      "\"117\" \"LUKE\" \"This R2 unit has a bad motivator.  Look!\"\n",
      "\"118\" \"OWEN\" \"Hey, what're you trying to push on us?\"\n",
      "\"119\" \"THREEPIO\" \"Excuse me, sir, but that R2 unit is in prime condition.  A real bargain.\"\n",
      "\"120\" \"LUKE\" \"Uncle Owen...\"\n",
      "\"121\" \"OWEN\" \"Yeah?\"\n",
      "\"122\" \"LUKE\" \"What about that one?\"\n",
      "\"123\" \"OWEN\" \"What about that blue one?  We'll take that one.\"\n",
      "\"124\" \"LUKE\" \"Yeah, take it away.\"\n",
      "\"125\" \"THREEPIO\" \"Uh, I'm quite sure you'll be very pleased with that one, sir.  He really is in first-class condition.  I've worked with him before.  Here he comes.\"\n",
      "\"126\" \"LUKE\" \"Okay, let's go.\"\n",
      "\"127\" \"THREEPIO\" \"Now, don't forget this!  Why I should stick my neck out for you is quite beyond my capacity!\"\n",
      "\"128\" \"THREEPIO\" \"Thank the maker!  This oil bath is going to feel so good.  I've got such a bad case of dust contamination, I can barely move!\"\n",
      "\"129\" \"LUKE\" \"It just isn't fair.  Oh, Biggs is right.  I'm never gonna get out of here!\"\n",
      "\"130\" \"THREEPIO\" \"Is there anything I might do to help? \"\n",
      "\"131\" \"LUKE\" \"Well, not unless you can alter time, speed up the harvest, or teleport me off this rock!\"\n",
      "\"132\" \"THREEPIO\" \"I don't think so, sir.  I'm only a droid and not very knowledgeable about such things.  Not on this planet, anyways.  As a matter of fact, I'm not even sure which planet I'm on.\"\n",
      "\"133\" \"LUKE\" \"Well, if there's a bright center to the universe, you're on the planet that it's farthest from.\"\n",
      "\"134\" \"THREEPIO\" \"I see, sir.\"\n",
      "\"135\" \"LUKE\" \"Uh, you can call me Luke.\"\n",
      "\"136\" \"THREEPIO\" \"I see, sir Luke.\"\n",
      "\"137\" \"LUKE\" \"Just Luke.\"\n",
      "\"138\" \"THREEPIO\" \"And I am See-Threepio, human-cyborg relations, and this is my counterpart, Artoo-Detoo.\"\n",
      "\"139\" \"LUKE\" \"Hello.\"\n",
      "\"140\" \"LUKE\" \"You got a lot of carbon scoring here.  It looks like you boys have seen a lot of action.\"\n",
      "\"141\" \"THREEPIO\" \"With all we've been through, sometimes I'm amazed we're in as good condition as we are, what with the Rebellion and all.\"\n",
      "\"142\" \"LUKE\" \"You know of the Rebellion against the Empire?\"\n",
      "\"143\" \"THREEPIO\" \"That's how we came to be in your service, if you take my meaning, sir.\"\n",
      "\"144\" \"LUKE\" \"Have you been in many battles?\"\n",
      "\"145\" \"THREEPIO\" \"Several, I think.  Actually, there's not much to tell.  I'm not much more than an interpreter, and not very good at telling stories.  Well, not at making them interesting, anyways.\"\n",
      "\"146\" \"LUKE\" \"Well, my little friend, you've got something jammed in here real good.  Were you on a starcruiser or...\"\n",
      "\"147\" \"LEIA\" \"Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.  You'remy only hope.\"\n",
      "\"148\" \"LUKE\" \"What's this?\"\n",
      "\"149\" \"THREEPIO\" \"What is what?!?  He asked you a question...What is that?\"\n",
      "\"150\" \"LEIA\" \"Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.  You're my only hope.  Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.  You're my only hope.\"\n",
      "\"151\" \"THREEPIO\" \"Oh, he says it's nothing, sir.  Merely a malfunction.  Old data.  Pay it no mind.\"\n",
      "\"152\" \"LUKE\" \"Who is she?  She's beautiful.\"\n",
      "\"153\" \"THREEPIO\" \"I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir.\"\n",
      "\"154\" \"LEIA\" \"Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi...\"\n",
      "\"155\" \"THREEPIO\" \"I think she was a passenger on our last voyage.  A person of some importance, sir - I believe.  Our captain was attached to...\"\n",
      "\"156\" \"LUKE\" \"Is there more to this recording?\"\n",
      "\"157\" \"THREEPIO\" \"Behave yourself, Artoo.  You're going to get us in trouble.  It's all right, you can trust him.  He's our new master.\"\n",
      "\"158\" \"THREEPIO\" \"He says he's the property of Obi-Wan Kenobi, a resident of these parts.  And it's a private message for him.  Quite frankly, sir, I don't know what he's talking about.  Our last master was Captain Antilles, but with what we've been through, this little R2 unit has become a bit eccentric.\"\n",
      "\"159\" \"LUKE\" \"Obi-Wan Kenobi?  I wonder if he means old Ben Kenobi?\"\n",
      "\"160\" \"THREEPIO\" \"I beg your pardon, sir, but do you know what he's talking about?\"\n",
      "\"161\" \"LUKE\" \"Well, I don't know anyone named Obi-Wan, but old Ben lives out beyond the dune sea.  He's kind of a strange old hermit.\"\n",
      "\"162\" \"LUKE\" \"I wonder who she is.  It sounds like she's in trouble.  I'd better play back the whole thing.\"\n",
      "\"163\" \"THREEPIO\" \"He says the restraining bolt has short circuited his recording system.  He suggests that if you remove the bolt, he might be able to play back the entire recording.\"\n",
      "\"164\" \"LUKE\" \"H'm?  Oh, yeah, well, I guess you're too small to run away on me if I take this off!  Okay.\"\n",
      "\"165\" \"LUKE\" \"There you go.\"\n",
      "\"166\" \"LUKE\" \"Well, wait a minute.  Where'd she go?  Bring her back!  Play back the entire message.\"\n",
      "\"167\" \"THREEPIO\" \"been playing.  The one you're carrying inside your rusty innards! \"\n",
      "\"168\" \"AUNT BERU\" \"Luke?  Luke!  Come to dinner!\"\n",
      "\"169\" \"LUKE\" \"All right, I'll be right there, Aunt Beru.\"\n",
      "\"170\" \"THREEPIO\" \"I'm sorry, sir, but he appears to have picked up a slight flutter.\"\n",
      "\"171\" \"LUKE\" \"Well, see what you can do with him.  I'll be right back.\"\n",
      "\"172\" \"THREEPIO\" \"Just you reconsider playing that message for him.\"\n",
      "\"173\" \"THREEPIO\" \"No, I don't think he likes you at all.\"\n",
      "\"174\" \"THREEPIO\" \"No, I don't like you either.\"\n",
      "\"175\" \"LUKE\" \"You know, I think that R2 unit we bought might have been stolen.\"\n",
      "\"176\" \"OWEN\" \"What makes you think that?\"\n",
      "\"177\" \"LUKE\" \"Well, I stumbled across a recording while I was cleaning him.  He says he belongs to someone called Obi-Wan Kenobi.\"\n",
      "\"178\" \"LUKE\" \"I thought he might have meant Ben.  Do you know what he's talking about?  Well, I wonder if he's related to Ben.\"\n",
      "\"179\" \"OWEN\" \"That old man's just a crazy wizard.  Tomorrow I want you to take that R2 unit into Anchorhead and have its memory flushed.  That'll be the end of it.  It belongs to us now.\"\n",
      "\"180\" \"LUKE\" \"But what if this Obi-Wan comes looking for him?\"\n",
      "\"181\" \"OWEN\" \"He won't, I don't think he exists any more.  He died about the same time as your father.\"\n",
      "\"182\" \"LUKE\" \"He knew my father?\"\n",
      "\"183\" \"OWEN\" \"I told you to forget it.  Your only concern is to prepare the new droids for tomorrow.  In the morning I want them on the south ridge working out those condensers.\"\n",
      "\"184\" \"LUKE\" \"Yes, sir.  I think those new droids are going to work out fine.  In fact, I, uh, was also thinking about our agreement about my staying on another season.  And if these new droids do work out, I want to transmit my application to the Academy this year.\"\n",
      "\"185\" \"OWEN\" \"You mean the next semester before harvest?\"\n",
      "\"186\" \"LUKE\" \"Sure, there're more than enough droids.\"\n",
      "\"187\" \"OWEN\" \"Harvest is when I need you the most.  Only one more season.  This year we'll make enough on the harvest so I'll be able to hire some more hands.  And then you can go to the Academy next year.\"\n",
      "\"188\" \"OWEN\" \"You must understand I need you here, Luke.\"\n",
      "\"189\" \"LUKE\" \"But it's a whole 'nother year.\"\n",
      "\"190\" \"OWEN\" \"Look, it's only one more season.\"\n",
      "\"191\" \"LUKE\" \"Yeah, that's what you said last year when Biggs and Tank left.\"\n",
      "\"192\" \"AUNT BERU\" \"Where are you going?\"\n",
      "\"193\" \"LUKE\" \"It looks like I'm going nowhere.  I have to finish cleaning those droids.\"\n",
      "\"194\" \"AUNT BERU\" \"Owen, he can't stay here forever.  Most of his friends have gone.  It means so much to him.\"\n",
      "\"195\" \"OWEN\" \"I'll make it up to him next year.  I promise.\"\n",
      "\"196\" \"AUNT BERU\" \"Luke's just not a farmer, Owen.  He has too much of his father in him.\"\n",
      "\"197\" \"OWEN\" \"That's what I'm afraid of.\"\n",
      "\"198\" \"LUKE\" \"What are you doing hiding there?\"\n",
      "\"199\" \"THREEPIO\" \"It wasn't my fault, sir.  Please don't deactivate me.  I told him not to go, but he's faulty, malfunctioning; kept babbling on about his mission.\"\n",
      "\"200\" \"LUKE\" \"Oh, no!\"\n",
      "\"201\" \"THREEPIO\" \"That R2 unit has always been a problem.  These astro-droids are getting quite out of hand.  Even I can't understand their logic at times. \"\n",
      "\"202\" \"LUKE\" \"How could I be so stupid?  He's nowhere in sight.  Blast it!\"\n",
      "\"203\" \"THREEPIO\" \"Pardon me, sir, but couldn't we go after him?\"\n",
      "\"204\" \"LUKE\" \"It's too dangerous with all the Sand People around.  We'll have to wait until morning.\"\n",
      "\"205\" \"OWEN\" \"Luke, I'm shutting the power down for the night.\"\n",
      "\"206\" \"LUKE\" \"All right, I'll be there in a few minutes.  Boy, am I gonna get it.\"\n",
      "\"207\" \"LUKE\" \"You know that little droid is going to cause me a lot of trouble.\"\n",
      "\"208\" \"THREEPIO\" \"Oh, he excels at that, sir.\"\n",
      "\"209\" \"OWEN\" \"Luke?  Luke?  Luke?  Where could he be loafing now!\"\n",
      "\"210\" \"OWEN\" \"Have you seen Luke this morning?\"\n",
      "\"211\" \"AUNT BERU\" \"He said he had some things to do before he started today, so he left early.\"\n",
      "\"212\" \"OWEN\" \"Uh?  Did he take those two new droids with him?\"\n",
      "\"213\" \"AUNT BERU\" \"I think so.\"\n",
      "\"214\" \"OWEN\" \"Well, he'd better have those units in the south range repaired bemidday or there'll be hell to pay!\"\n",
      "\"215\" \"LUKE\" \"How's that.\"\n",
      "\"216\" \"LUKE\" \"Old Ben Kenobi lives out in this direction somewhere, but I don't see how that R2 unit could have come this far.  We must have missed him.  Uncle Owen isn't going to take this very well.\"\n",
      "\"217\" \"THREEPIO\" \"Sir, would it help if you told him it was my fault.\"\n",
      "\"218\" \"LUKE\" \"Sure.  He needs you.  He'd probably only deactivate you for a day or so...\"\n",
      "\"219\" \"THREEPIO\" \"Deactivate!  Well, on the other hand if you hadn't removed his restraining bolt...\"\n",
      "\"220\" \"LUKE\" \"Wait, there's something dead ahead on the scanner.  It looks like our droid... hit the accelerator.\"\n",
      "\"221\" \"LUKE\" \"Hey, whoa, just where do you think you're going?\"\n",
      "\"222\" \"THREEPIO\" \"Master Luke here is your rightful owner.  We'll have no more of this Obi-Wan Kenobi jibberish... and don't talk to me of your mission, either.  You're fortunate he doesn't blast you into a million pieces right here.\"\n",
      "\"223\" \"LUKE\" \"Well, come on. It's getting late.  I only hope we can get back before Uncle Owen really blows up.\"\n",
      "\"224\" \"THREEPIO\" \"If you don't mind my saying so, sir, I think you should deactivate the little fugitive until you've gotten him back to your workshop.\"\n",
      "\"225\" \"LUKE\" \"No, he's not going to try anything.\"\n",
      "\"226\" \"LUKE\" \"What's wrong with him now?\"\n",
      "\"227\" \"THREEPIO\" \"Oh my... sir, he says there are several creatures approaching from the southeast.\"\n",
      "\"228\" \"LUKE\" \"Sand People!  Or worse!  Come on, let's have a look.  Come on.\"\n",
      "\"229\" \"LUKE\" \"There are two Banthas down there but I don't see any... wait a second, they're Sand People all right.  I can see one of them now.\"\n",
      "\"230\" \"BEN\" \"Hello there!  Come here my little friend.  Don't be afraid.\"\n",
      "\"231\" \"BEN\" \"Don't worry, he'll be all right.\"\n",
      "\"232\" \"LUKE\" \"What happened?\"\n",
      "\"233\" \"BEN\" \"Rest easy, son, you've had a busy day.  You're fortunate you're still in one piece.\"\n",
      "\"234\" \"LUKE\" \"Ben?  Ben Kenobi!  Boy, am I glad to see you! \"\n",
      "\"235\" \"BEN\" \"The Jundland Wastes are not to be traveled lightly.  Tell me, young Luke, what brings you out this far?\"\n",
      "\"236\" \"LUKE\" \"Oh, this little droid!  I think he's searching for his former master...  I've never seen such devotion in a droid before... there seems tobe no stopping him.  He claims to be the property of an Obi-Wan Kenobi.  Is he a relative of yours?  Do you know who he's talking about?\"\n",
      "\"237\" \"BEN\" \"Obi-Wan Kenobi... Obi-Wan?  Now thats a name I haven't heard in a long time... a long time.\"\n",
      "\"238\" \"LUKE\" \"I think my uncle knew him.  He said he was dead.\"\n",
      "\"239\" \"BEN\" \"Oh, he's not dead, no... not yet.\"\n",
      "\"240\" \"LUKE\" \"You know him!\"\n",
      "\"241\" \"BEN\" \"Well of course, of course I know him.  He's me!  I haven't gone by the name Obi-Wan since oh, before you were born.\"\n",
      "\"242\" \"LUKE\" \"Then the droid does belong to you.\"\n",
      "\"243\" \"BEN\" \"Don't seem to remember ever owning a droid.  Very interesting... \"\n",
      "\"244\" \"BEN\" \"I think we better get indoors.  The Sand People are easily startled but they will soon be back and in greater numbers.\"\n",
      "\"245\" \"LUKE\" \"... Threepio!\"\n",
      "\"246\" \"THREEPIO\" \"Where am I?  I must have taken a bad step...\"\n",
      "\"247\" \"LUKE\" \"Can you stand?  We've got to get out of here before the Sand People return.\"\n",
      "\"248\" \"THREEPIO\" \"I don't think I can make it.  You go on, Master Luke.  There's no sense in you risking yourself on my account.  I'm done for.\"\n",
      "\"249\" \"LUKE\" \"No, you're not.  What kind of talk is that?\"\n",
      "\"250\" \"BEN\" \"Quickly, son... they're on the move.\"\n",
      "\"251\" \"LUKE\" \"No, my father didn't fight in the wars.  He was a navigator on a spice freighter.\"\n",
      "\"252\" \"BEN\" \"That's what your uncle told you.  He didn't hold with your father's ideals.  Thought he should have stayed here and not gotten involved.\"\n",
      "\"253\" \"LUKE\" \"You fought in the Clone Wars?\"\n",
      "\"254\" \"BEN\" \"Yes, I was once a Jedi Knight the same as your father.\"\n",
      "\"255\" \"LUKE\" \"I wish I'd known him.\"\n",
      "\"256\" \"BEN\" \"He was the best star-pilot in the galaxy, and a cunning warrior.  I understand you've become quite a good pilot yourself.  And he was a good friend.  Which reminds me...\"\n",
      "\"257\" \"BEN\" \"I have something here for you.  Your father wanted you to have this when you were old enough, but your uncle wouldn't allow it.  He feared you might follow old Obi-Wan on some damned-fool idealistic crusade like your father did. \"\n",
      "\"258\" \"THREEPIO\" \"Sir, if you'll not be needing me, I'll close down for awhile.\"\n",
      "\"259\" \"LUKE\" \"Sure, go ahead.\"\n",
      "\"260\" \"LUKE\" \"What is it?\"\n",
      "\"261\" \"BEN\" \"Your fathers lightsaber.  This is the weapon of a Jedi Knight.  Not as clumsy or as random as a blaster.\"\n",
      "\"262\" \"BEN\" \"An elegant weapon for a morecivilized time.  For over a thousand generations the Jedi Knights were the guardians of peace and justice in the Old Republic.  Before the dark times, before the Empire.\"\n",
      "\"263\" \"LUKE\" \"How did my father die?\"\n",
      "\"264\" \"BEN\" \"A young Jedi named Darth Vader, who was a pupil of mine until he turned to evil, helped the Empire hunt down and destroy the Jedi Knights.  He betrayed and murdered your father.  Now the Jedi are all but extinct.  Vader was seduced by the dark side of the Force.\"\n",
      "\"265\" \"LUKE\" \"The Force?\"\n",
      "\"266\" \"BEN\" \"Well, the Force is what gives the Jedi his power.  It's an energy field created by all living things.  It surrounds us and penetrates us.  It binds the galaxy together.\"\n",
      "\"267\" \"BEN\" \"Now, let's see if we can't figure out what you are, my little friend.  And where you come from.\"\n",
      "\"268\" \"LUKE\" \"I saw part of the message he was...\"\n",

      "\"270\" \"LEIA\" \"General Kenobi, years ago you served my father in the Clone Wars.  Now he begs you to help him in his struggle against the Empire.  I regret that I am unable to present my father's request to you in person, but my ship has fallen under attack and I'm afraid my mission to bring you to Alderaan has failed.  I have placed information vital to the survival of the Rebellion into the memory systems of this R2 unit.  My father will know how to retrieve it.  You must see this droid safely delivered to him on Alderaan.  This is our most desperate hour.  Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi, you're my only hope.\"\n",
      "\"271\" \"BEN\" \"You must learn the ways of the Force if you're to come with me to Alderaan.\"\n",

      "\"290\" \"MOTTI\" \"Don't try to frighten us with your sorcerer's ways, Lord Vader.  Your sad devotion to that ancient religion has not helped you conjure up the stolen data tapes, or given you clairvoyance enough to find the Rebel's hidden fort...\"\n",

      "\"396\" \"JABBA\" \"Han, why you're the best smuggler in the business.  You're too valuable to fry.  He was only relaying my concern at your delays.  He wasn't going to blast you.\"\n",
      "\"397\" \"HAN\" \"I think he thought he was.  Next time don't send one of those twerps.  If you've got something to say to me, come see me yourself.\"\n",
      "\"398\" \"JABBA\" \"Han, Han!  If only you hadn't had to dump that shipment of spice... you understand I just can't make an exception.  Where would I be if every pilot who smuggled for me dumped their shipment at the first sign of an Imperial starship?  It's not good business.\"\n",
      "\"399\" \"HAN\" \"You know, even I get boarded sometimes, Jabba.  I had no choice, but I've gota charter now and I can pay you back, plus a little extra.  I just need some more time.\"\n",

So, for an extra, say... twenty percent I'll give you a little more time... but this is it.  If you disappoint me again, I'll put a price on your head so large you won't be able to go near a civilized system for the rest of your short life.\"\n",

      "\"611\" \"LANDO\" \"Oh, not as well as I'd like. We're a small outpost and not very  self-sufficient. And I've had supply problems of every kind. I've had labor difficulties... What's so funny?\"\n",

      "\"636\" \"LUKE\" \"You won't.\"\n",
      "\"637\" \"YODA\" \"Stopped they must be. On this depends. Only a fully trained Jedi  Knight with the Force as his ally will conquer Vader and his Emperor. If you end your training now, if you choose the quick and easy path, as Vader did, you will become an agent of evil.\"\n",
      "\"638\" \"BEN\" \"Patience.\"\n",
      "\"639\" \"LUKE\" \"And sacrifice Han and Leia?\"\n",
      "\"640\" \"YODA\" \"If you honor what they fight for...yes!\"\n",

      "\"648\" \"YODA\" \"No. There is another.\"\n",
      "\"649\" \"HAN\" \"The ship is almost finished. Two or Three more things and we're  in great shape.\"\n",

      "\"652\" \"LEIA\" \"I don't trust Lando.\"\n",
      "\"653\" \"HAN\" \"Well, I don't trust him, either. But he is my friend. Besides,  we'll soon be gone.\"\n",

      "\"655\" \"LEIA\" \"What happened?\"\n",
      "\"656\" \"HAN\" \"Where? Found him in a junk pile?\"\n",

      "\"666\" \"LANDO\" \"Having trouble with you droid?\"\n",
      "\"667\" \"HAN\" \"No. No problem. Why?\"\n",
      "\"668\" \"LANDO\" \"So you see, since we're a small operation, we don't fall into  the...uh...jurisdiction of the Empire.\"\n",
      "\"669\" \"LEIA\" \"So you're part of the mining guild then?\"\n",
      "\"670\" \"LANDO\" \"No, not actually. Our operation is small enough not to be  noticed...which is advantageous for everybody since our customers are anxious to avoid attracting attention to themselves.\"\n",
      "\"671\" \"HAN\" \"Aren't you afraid the Empire's going to find out about this  little operation and shut you down?\"\n",
      "\"672\" \"LANDO\" \"That's always been a danger looming like a shadow over  everything we've built here. But things have developed that will insure security. I've just made a deal that will keep the Empire out of here forever.\"\n",
      "\"673\" \"VADER\" \"We would be honored if you would join us.\"\n",
      "\"674\" \"LANDO\" \"I had no choice. They arrived right before you did. I'm sorry.\"\n",

      "\"676\" \"LUKE\" \"No, Threepio's with them.\"\n",
      "\"677\" \"LUKE\" \"Just hang on. We're almost there.\"\n",
      "\"678\" \"THREEPIO\" \"Mmmm. Oh, my. Uh, I, uh -- Take this off! I, uh, don't mean  to intrude here. I, don't, no, no, no...Please don't get up. No!\"\n",
      "\"679\" \"THREEPIO\" \"Stormtroopers? Here? We're in danger. I must tell the  others. Oh, no! I've been shot!\"\n",

      "\"685\" \"VADER\" \"They must never again leave this city.\"\n",
      "\"686\" \"LANDO\" \"That was never a condition of our agreement, nor was giving Han  to this bounty hunter!\"\n",

      "\"688\" \"LANDO\" \"No.\"\n",
      "\"689\" \"VADER\" \"Good. It would be unfortunate if I had to leave a garrison  here.\"\n",

      "\"691\" \"THREEPIO\" \"Oh, yes, that's very good. I like that. Oh! Something's not  right because now I can't see. Wait. Wait! Oh, my! what have you done? I'm backwards, you stupid furball. Only an overgrown mophead like you would be stupid enough...\"\n",
      "\"692\" \"HAN\" \"I feel terrible.\"\n",

      "\"714\" \"VADER\" \"Good. Monitor Skywalker and allow him to land.\"\n",
