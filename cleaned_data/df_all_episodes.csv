LUKE,But there was a lot of firing earlier...,episode IV
LUKE,"Hey, easy with those...",episode IV
CAMIE,"Dont worry about it, Wormie.",episode IV
FIXER,"I keep telling you, the Rebellion is a long way from here.  I doubt if the Empire would even fight to keep this system.  Believe me Luke, this planet is a big hunk of nothing...",episode IV

VADER,"Dont play games with me, Your Highness.  You werent on any mercy mission this time.  You passed directly through a restricted system.  Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies.  I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you.",episode IV
LEIA,I dont know what youre talking about.  Im a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan...,episode IV
VADER,Youre a part of the Rebel Alliance... and a traitor.  Take her away,episode IV

COMMANDER,you anything.,episode IV
VADER,Leave that to me.  Send a distress signal and then inform the senate that all aboard were killed,episode IV

COMMANDER,"Yes, sir.",episode IV
THREEPIO,How did I get into this mess  I really dont know how.  We seem to be made to suffer.  Its our lot in life.,episode IV
THREEPIO,Ive got to rest before I fall apart.  My joints are almost frozen. ,episode IV
THREEPIO,What a desolate place this is.,episode IV
THREEPIO,Where are you going,episode IV
THREEPIO,"Well, Im not going that way.  Its much too rocky.  This way is much easier.",episode IV
THREEPIO,What makes you think there are settlements over there,episode IV
THREEPIO,Dont get technical with me.,episode IV
THREEPIO,"What mission  What are you talking about  Ive had just about enough of you  Go that way  Youll be malfunctioning within a day, you nearsighted scrap pile",episode IV
THREEPIO,"And dont let me catch you following me begging for help, because you wont get it.",episode IV
THREEPIO,No more adventures.  Im not going that way.,episode IV

THREEPIO,"Wait, whats that  A transport  Im saved",episode IV
THREEPIO,"Over here  Help  Please, help",episode IV
LUKE,"... so I cut off my power, shut down the afterburners and came in low on Deaks trail.  I was so close I thought I was going to fry my instruments. As it was I busted up the Skyhopper pretty bad.  Uncle Owen was pretty upset.  He grounded me for the rest of the season.  You should have been there... it was fantastic.",episode IV
BIGGS,"You ought to take it a little easy Luke.  You may be the hottest bushpilot this side of Mos Eisley, but those little Skyhoppers are dangerous.  Keep it up, and one day, whammo, youre going to be nothing more than a dark spot on the down side of a canyon wall.",episode IV
LUKE,Look whos talking.  Now that youve been around those giant starships youre beginning to sound like my uncle. Youve gotten soft in the city...,episode IV
BIGGS,Ive missed you kid.,episode IV
LUKE,"Well, things havent been the same since you left, Biggs.  Its been so...quiet.",episode IV
BIGGS,"Luke, I didnt come back just to say goodbye...  I shouldnt tell you this, but youre the only one I can trust... and if I dont come back, I want somebody to know.",episode IV
LUKE,What are you talking about,episode IV
BIGGS,"I made some friends at the Academy. ... when our frigate goes to one of the central systems, were going to jump ship and join the Alliance...",episode IV
LUKE,Join the Rebellion  Are you kidding  How,episode IV
BIGGS,Quiet down will ya  You got a mouth bigger than a meteor crater,episode IV
LUKE,Im sorry.  Im quiet. Listen how quiet I am.  You can barely hear me...,episode IV
BIGGS,My friend has a friend on Bestine who might help us make contact.,episode IV
LUKE,around forever trying to find them.,episode IV
BIGGS,"I know its a long shot, but if I dont find them Ill do what I can on my own...  Its what we always talked about.  Luke, Im not going to wait for the Empire to draft me into service.  The Rebellion is spreading and I want to be on the right side - the side I believe in. ",episode IV
LUKE,And Im stuck here...,episode IV
BIGGS,I thought you were going to the Academy next term.  Youll get your chance to get off this rock.,episode IV
LUKE,Not likely  I had to cancel my application.  There has been a lot of unrest among the Sand People since you left... theyve even raided the outskirts of Anchorhead.,episode IV
BIGGS,Your uncle could hold off a whole colony of Sand People with one blaster.,episode IV
LUKE,"I know, but hes got enough vaporators going to make the place pay off.  He needs me for just one more season.  I cant leave him now.",episode IV
BIGGS,"I feel for you, Luke, youre going to have to learn what seems to be important or what really is important.  What good is all your uncles work if its taken over by the Empire...  You know theyre starting to nationalize commerce in the central systems...it wont be long before your uncle is merely a tenant, slaving for the greater glory of the Empire.",episode IV
LUKE,It couldnt happen here.  You said it yourself.  The Empire wont bother with this rock.,episode IV
BIGGS,Things always change.,episode IV
LUKE,I wish I was going...  Are you going to be around long ,episode IV
BIGGS,"No, Im leaving in the morning...",episode IV
LUKE,Then I guess I wont see you.,episode IV
BIGGS,Maybe someday...  Ill keep a lookout.,episode IV
LUKE,"Well, Ill be at the Academy next season... after that who knows.  I wont be drafted into the Imperial Starfleet thats for sure...  Take care of yourself, youll always be the best friend Ive got.",episode IV
BIGGS,"So long, Luke.",episode IV
THREEPIO,Artoo-Detoo  Its you  Its you,episode IV

SECOND TROOPER,"Look, sir - droids.",episode IV
THREEPIO,Wake up  Wake up,episode IV
THREEPIO,Were doomed.,episode IV
THREEPIO,Do you think theyll melt us down,episode IV
THREEPIO,Dont shoot  Dont shoot  Will this never end,episode IV
BERU,"Luke, tell Owen that if he gets a translator to be sure it speaks Bocce.",episode IV
LUKE,It looks like we dont have much of a choice but Ill remind him.,episode IV
OWEN,I have no need for a protocol droid.,episode IV
THREEPIO,Sir - not in an environment such as this - thats why Ive also been programmed for over thirty secondary functions that...,episode IV
OWEN,What I really need is a droid that understands the binary languages of moisture vaporators.,episode IV
THREEPIO,Vaporators  Sir - My first job was programming binary load lifters... very similar to your vaporators.  You could say...,episode IV
OWEN,Do you speak Bocce,episode IV
THREEPIO,"Of course I can, sir.  Its like a second language for me...  Im as fluent in Bocce...",episode IV
OWEN,All right shut up Ill take this one.,episode IV
THREEPIO,"Shutting up, sir.",episode IV
OWEN,"Luke, take these two over to the garage, will you  I want you to have both of them cleaned up before dinner.",episode IV
LUKE,But I was going into Toshi Station to pick up some power converters...,episode IV
OWEN,"You can waste time with your friends when your chores are done.  Now, come on, get to it",episode IV
LUKE,"All right, come on  And the red one, come on.  Well, come on, Red, lets go.",episode IV
LUKE,Uncle Owen...,episode IV
OWEN,Yeah,episode IV
LUKE,This R2 unit has a bad motivator.  Look,episode IV
OWEN,"Hey, whatre you trying to push on us",episode IV
THREEPIO,"Excuse me, sir, but that R2 unit is in prime condition.  A real bargain.",episode IV
LUKE,Uncle Owen...,episode IV
OWEN,Yeah,episode IV
LUKE,What about that one,episode IV
OWEN,What about that blue one  Well take that one.,episode IV
LUKE,"Yeah, take it away.",episode IV
THREEPIO,"Uh, Im quite sure youll be very pleased with that one, sir.  He really is in first-class condition.  Ive worked with him before.  Here he comes.",episode IV
LUKE,"Okay, lets go.",episode IV
THREEPIO,"Now, dont forget this  Why I should stick my neck out for you is quite beyond my capacity",episode IV
THREEPIO,"Thank the maker  This oil bath is going to feel so good.  Ive got such a bad case of dust contamination, I can barely move",episode IV
LUKE,"It just isnt fair.  Oh, Biggs is right.  Im never gonna get out of here",episode IV
THREEPIO,Is there anything I might do to help ,episode IV
LUKE,"Well, not unless you can alter time, speed up the harvest, or teleport me off this rock",episode IV
THREEPIO,"I dont think so, sir.  Im only a droid and not very knowledgeable about such things.  Not on this planet, anyways.  As a matter of fact, Im not even sure which planet Im on.",episode IV
LUKE,"Well, if theres a bright center to the universe, youre on the planet that its farthest from.",episode IV
THREEPIO,"I see, sir.",episode IV
LUKE,"Uh, you can call me Luke.",episode IV
THREEPIO,"I see, sir Luke.",episode IV
LUKE,Just Luke.,episode IV
THREEPIO,"And I am See-Threepio, human-cyborg relations, and this is my counterpart, Artoo-Detoo.",episode IV
LUKE,Hello.,episode IV
LUKE,You got a lot of carbon scoring here.  It looks like you boys have seen a lot of action.,episode IV
THREEPIO,"With all weve been through, sometimes Im amazed were in as good condition as we are, what with the Rebellion and all.",episode IV
LUKE,You know of the Rebellion against the Empire,episode IV
THREEPIO,"Thats how we came to be in your service, if you take my meaning, sir.",episode IV
LUKE,Have you been in many battles,episode IV
THREEPIO,"Several, I think.  Actually, theres not much to tell.  Im not much more than an interpreter, and not very good at telling stories.  Well, not at making them interesting, anyways.",episode IV
LUKE,"Well, my little friend, youve got something jammed in here real good.  Were you on a starcruiser or...",episode IV
LEIA,"Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.  Youremy only hope.",episode IV
LUKE,Whats this,episode IV
THREEPIO,What is what  He asked you a question...What is that,episode IV
LEIA,"Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.  Youre my only hope.  Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.  Youre my only hope.",episode IV
THREEPIO,"Oh, he says its nothing, sir.  Merely a malfunction.  Old data.  Pay it no mind.",episode IV
LUKE,Who is she  Shes beautiful.,episode IV
THREEPIO,"Im afraid Im not quite sure, sir.",episode IV
LEIA,"Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi...",episode IV
THREEPIO,"I think she was a passenger on our last voyage.  A person of some importance, sir - I believe.  Our captain was attached to...",episode IV
LUKE,Is there more to this recording,episode IV
THREEPIO,"Behave yourself, Artoo.  Youre going to get us in trouble.  Its all right, you can trust him.  Hes our new master.",episode IV
THREEPIO,"He says hes the property of Obi-Wan Kenobi, a resident of these parts.  And its a private message for him.  Quite frankly, sir, I dont know what hes talking about.  Our last master was Captain Antilles, but with what weve been through, this little R2 unit has become a bit eccentric.",episode IV
LUKE,Obi-Wan Kenobi  I wonder if he means old Ben Kenobi,episode IV
THREEPIO,"I beg your pardon, sir, but do you know what hes talking about",episode IV
LUKE,"Well, I dont know anyone named Obi-Wan, but old Ben lives out beyond the dune sea.  Hes kind of a strange old hermit.",episode IV
LUKE,I wonder who she is.  It sounds like shes in trouble.  Id better play back the whole thing.,episode IV
THREEPIO,"He says the restraining bolt has short circuited his recording system.  He suggests that if you remove the bolt, he might be able to play back the entire recording.",episode IV
LUKE,"Hm  Oh, yeah, well, I guess youre too small to run away on me if I take this off  Okay.",episode IV
LUKE,There you go.,episode IV
LUKE,"Well, wait a minute.  Whered she go  Bring her back  Play back the entire message.",episode IV
THREEPIO,been playing.  The one youre carrying inside your rusty innards ,episode IV
AUNT BERU,Luke  Luke  Come to dinner,episode IV
LUKE,"All right, Ill be right there, Aunt Beru.",episode IV
THREEPIO,"Im sorry, sir, but he appears to have picked up a slight flutter.",episode IV
LUKE,"Well, see what you can do with him.  Ill be right back.",episode IV
THREEPIO,Just you reconsider playing that message for him.,episode IV
THREEPIO,"No, I dont think he likes you at all.",episode IV
THREEPIO,"No, I dont like you either.",episode IV
LUKE,"You know, I think that R2 unit we bought might have been stolen.",episode IV
OWEN,What makes you think that,episode IV
LUKE,"Well, I stumbled across a recording while I was cleaning him.  He says he belongs to someone called Obi-Wan Kenobi.",episode IV
LUKE,"I thought he might have meant Ben.  Do you know what hes talking about  Well, I wonder if hes related to Ben.",episode IV
OWEN,That old mans just a crazy wizard.  Tomorrow I want you to take that R2 unit into Anchorhead and have its memory flushed.  Thatll be the end of it.  It belongs to us now.,episode IV
LUKE,But what if this Obi-Wan comes looking for him,episode IV
OWEN,"He wont, I dont think he exists any more.  He died about the same time as your father.",episode IV
LUKE,He knew my father,episode IV
OWEN,I told you to forget it.  Your only concern is to prepare the new droids for tomorrow.  In the morning I want them on the south ridge working out those condensers.,episode IV
LUKE,"Yes, sir.  I think those new droids are going to work out fine.  In fact, I, uh, was also thinking about our agreement about my staying on another season.  And if these new droids do work out, I want to transmit my application to the Academy this year.",episode IV
OWEN,You mean the next semester before harvest,episode IV
LUKE,"Sure, therere more than enough droids.",episode IV
OWEN,Harvest is when I need you the most.  Only one more season.  This year well make enough on the harvest so Ill be able to hire some more hands.  And then you can go to the Academy next year.,episode IV
OWEN,"You must understand I need you here, Luke.",episode IV
LUKE,But its a whole nother year.,episode IV
OWEN,"Look, its only one more season.",episode IV
LUKE,"Yeah, thats what you said last year when Biggs and Tank left.",episode IV
AUNT BERU,Where are you going,episode IV
LUKE,It looks like Im going nowhere.  I have to finish cleaning those droids.,episode IV
AUNT BERU,"Owen, he cant stay here forever.  Most of his friends have gone.  It means so much to him.",episode IV
OWEN,Ill make it up to him next year.  I promise.,episode IV
AUNT BERU,"Lukes just not a farmer, Owen.  He has too much of his father in him.",episode IV
OWEN,Thats what Im afraid of.,episode IV
LUKE,What are you doing hiding there,episode IV
THREEPIO,"It wasnt my fault, sir.  Please dont deactivate me.  I told him not to go, but hes faulty, malfunctioning kept babbling on about his mission.",episode IV
LUKE,"Oh, no",episode IV
THREEPIO,That R2 unit has always been a problem.  These astro-droids are getting quite out of hand.  Even I cant understand their logic at times. ,episode IV
LUKE,How could I be so stupid  Hes nowhere in sight.  Blast it,episode IV
THREEPIO,"Pardon me, sir, but couldnt we go after him",episode IV
LUKE,Its too dangerous with all the Sand People around.  Well have to wait until morning.,episode IV
OWEN,"Luke, Im shutting the power down for the night.",episode IV
LUKE,"All right, Ill be there in a few minutes.  Boy, am I gonna get it.",episode IV
LUKE,You know that little droid is going to cause me a lot of trouble.,episode IV
THREEPIO,"Oh, he excels at that, sir.",episode IV
OWEN,Luke  Luke  Luke  Where could he be loafing now,episode IV
OWEN,Have you seen Luke this morning,episode IV
AUNT BERU,"He said he had some things to do before he started today, so he left early.",episode IV
OWEN,Uh  Did he take those two new droids with him,episode IV
AUNT BERU,I think so.,episode IV
OWEN,"Well, hed better have those units in the south range repaired bemidday or therell be hell to pay",episode IV
LUKE,Hows that.,episode IV
LUKE,"Old Ben Kenobi lives out in this direction somewhere, but I dont see how that R2 unit could have come this far.  We must have missed him.  Uncle Owen isnt going to take this very well.",episode IV
THREEPIO,"Sir, would it help if you told him it was my fault.",episode IV
LUKE,Sure.  He needs you.  Hed probably only deactivate you for a day or so...,episode IV
THREEPIO,"Deactivate  Well, on the other hand if you hadnt removed his restraining bolt...",episode IV
LUKE,"Wait, theres something dead ahead on the scanner.  It looks like our droid... hit the accelerator.",episode IV
LUKE,"Hey, whoa, just where do you think youre going",episode IV
THREEPIO,"Master Luke here is your rightful owner.  Well have no more of this Obi-Wan Kenobi jibberish... and dont talk to me of your mission, either.  Youre fortunate he doesnt blast you into a million pieces right here.",episode IV
LUKE,"Well, come on. Its getting late.  I only hope we can get back before Uncle Owen really blows up.",episode IV
THREEPIO,"If you dont mind my saying so, sir, I think you should deactivate the little fugitive until youve gotten him back to your workshop.",episode IV
LUKE,"No, hes not going to try anything.",episode IV
LUKE,Whats wrong with him now,episode IV
THREEPIO,"Oh my... sir, he says there are several creatures approaching from the southeast.",episode IV
LUKE,"Sand People  Or worse  Come on, lets have a look.  Come on.",episode IV
LUKE,"There are two Banthas down there but I dont see any... wait a second, theyre Sand People all right.  I can see one of them now.",episode IV
BEN,Hello there  Come here my little friend.  Dont be afraid.,episode IV
BEN,"Dont worry, hell be all right.",episode IV
LUKE,What happened,episode IV
BEN,"Rest easy, son, youve had a busy day.  Youre fortunate youre still in one piece.",episode IV
LUKE,"Ben  Ben Kenobi  Boy, am I glad to see you ",episode IV
BEN,"The Jundland Wastes are not to be traveled lightly.  Tell me, young Luke, what brings you out this far",episode IV
LUKE,"Oh, this little droid  I think hes searching for his former master...  Ive never seen such devotion in a droid before... there seems tobe no stopping him.  He claims to be the property of an Obi-Wan Kenobi.  Is he a relative of yours  Do you know who hes talking about",episode IV
BEN,Obi-Wan Kenobi... Obi-Wan  Now thats a name I havent heard in a long time... a long time.,episode IV
LUKE,I think my uncle knew him.  He said he was dead.,episode IV
BEN,"Oh, hes not dead, no... not yet.",episode IV
LUKE,You know him,episode IV
BEN,"Well of course, of course I know him.  Hes me  I havent gone by the name Obi-Wan since oh, before you were born.",episode IV
LUKE,Then the droid does belong to you.,episode IV
BEN,Dont seem to remember ever owning a droid.  Very interesting... ,episode IV
BEN,I think we better get indoors.  The Sand People are easily startled but they will soon be back and in greater numbers.,episode IV
LUKE,... Threepio,episode IV
THREEPIO,Where am I  I must have taken a bad step...,episode IV
LUKE,Can you stand  Weve got to get out of here before the Sand People return.,episode IV
THREEPIO,"I dont think I can make it.  You go on, Master Luke.  Theres no sense in you risking yourself on my account.  Im done for.",episode IV
LUKE,"No, youre not.  What kind of talk is that",episode IV
BEN,"Quickly, son... theyre on the move.",episode IV
LUKE,"No, my father didnt fight in the wars.  He was a navigator on a spice freighter.",episode IV
BEN,Thats what your uncle told you.  He didnt hold with your fathers ideals.  Thought he should have stayed here and not gotten involved.,episode IV
LUKE,You fought in the Clone Wars,episode IV
BEN,"Yes, I was once a Jedi Knight the same as your father.",episode IV
LUKE,I wish Id known him.,episode IV
BEN,"He was the best star-pilot in the galaxy, and a cunning warrior.  I understand youve become quite a good pilot yourself.  And he was a good friend.  Which reminds me...",episode IV
BEN,"I have something here for you.  Your father wanted you to have this when you were old enough, but your uncle wouldnt allow it.  He feared you might follow old Obi-Wan on some damned-fool idealistic crusade like your father did. ",episode IV
THREEPIO,"Sir, if youll not be needing me, Ill close down for awhile.",episode IV
LUKE,"Sure, go ahead.",episode IV
LUKE,What is it,episode IV
BEN,Your fathers lightsaber.  This is the weapon of a Jedi Knight.  Not as clumsy or as random as a blaster.,episode IV
BEN,"An elegant weapon for a morecivilized time.  For over a thousand generations the Jedi Knights were the guardians of peace and justice in the Old Republic.  Before the dark times, before the Empire.",episode IV
LUKE,How did my father die,episode IV
BEN,"A young Jedi named Darth Vader, who was a pupil of mine until he turned to evil, helped the Empire hunt down and destroy the Jedi Knights.  He betrayed and murdered your father.  Now the Jedi are all but extinct.  Vader was seduced by the dark side of the Force.",episode IV
LUKE,The Force,episode IV
BEN,"Well, the Force is what gives the Jedi his power.  Its an energy field created by all living things.  It surrounds us and penetrates us.  It binds the galaxy together.",episode IV
BEN,"Now, lets see if we cant figure out what you are, my little friend.  And where you come from.",episode IV
LUKE,I saw part of the message he was...,episode IV
BEN,I seem to have found it.,episode IV
LEIA,"General Kenobi, years ago you served my father in the Clone Wars.  Now he begs you to help him in his struggle against the Empire.  I regret that I am unable to present my fathers request to you in person, but my ship has fallen under attack and Im afraid my mission to bring you to Alderaan has failed.  I have placed information vital to the survival of the Rebellion into the memory systems of this R2 unit.  My father will know how to retrieve it.  You must see this droid safely delivered to him on Alderaan.  This is our most desperate hour.  Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi, youre my only hope.",episode IV
BEN,You must learn the ways of the Force if youre to come with me to Alderaan.,episode IV
LUKE,"Alderaan  Im not going to Alderaan.  Ive got to go home.  Its late, Im in for it as it is.",episode IV
BEN,"I need your help, Luke.  Im getting too old for this sort of thing.She needs your help.",episode IV
LUKE,I cant get involved  Ive got work to do  Its not that I like the Empire.  I hate it  But theres nothing I can do about it right now.  Its such a long way from here.,episode IV
BEN,Thats your uncle talking.,episode IV
LUKE,"Oh, God, my uncle.  How am I ever going to explain this",episode IV
BEN,"Learn about the Force, Luke.",episode IV
LUKE,"Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead.  You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever youre going.",episode IV
BEN,"You must do what you feel is right, of course.",episode IV
TAGGE,Until this battle station is fully operational we are vulnerable.  The Rebel Alliance is too well equipped.  Theyre more dangerous than you realize.,episode IV
MOTTI,"Dangerous to your starfleet, Commander not to this battle station",episode IV
TAGGE,The Rebellion will continue to gain support in the Imperial Senate as long as....,episode IV
TARKIN,The Imperial Senate will no longer be of any concern to us.  Ive just received word that the Emperor has dissolved the council permanently.  The last remnants of the Old Republic have been swept away.,episode IV
TAGGE,Thats impossible  How will the Emperor maintain control without the bureaucracy,episode IV
TARKIN,The regional governors now have direct control over territories.  Fear will keep the local systems in line.  Fear of this battle station.,episode IV
TAGGE,"And what of the Rebellion  If the Rebels have obtained a complete technical readout of this station, it is possible, however unlikely, that they might find a weakness and exploit it.",episode IV
VADER,The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands.,episode IV
MOTTI,"Any attack made by the Rebels against this station would be a useless gesture, no matter what technical data theyve obtained.  This station is now the ultimate power in the universe.  I suggest we use it",episode IV
VADER,Dont be too proud of this technological terror youve constructed.  The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force.,episode IV
MOTTI,"Dont try to frighten us with your sorcerers ways, Lord Vader.  Your sad devotion to that ancient religion has not helped you conjure up the stolen data tapes, or given you clairvoyance enough to find the Rebels hidden fort...",episode IV
VADER,I find your lack of faith disturbing.,episode IV
TARKIN,"Enough of this  Vader, release him",episode IV
VADER,As you wish.,episode IV
TARKIN,This bickering is pointless.  Lord Vader will provide us with the location of the Rebel fortress by the time this station is operational.  We will then crush the Rebellion with one swift stroke.,episode IV
LUKE,"It looks like Sand People did this, all right.  Look, here are gaffi sticks, bantha tracks.  Its just... I never heard of them hitting anything this big before.",episode IV
BEN,They didnt.  But we are meant to think they did.  These tracks are side by side.  Sand People always ride single file to hide there numbers.,episode IV
LUKE,These are the same Jawas that sold us Artoo and Threepio.,episode IV
BEN,"And these blast points, too accurate for Sand People.  Only Imperial stormtroopers are so precise.",episode IV
LUKE,Why would Imperial troops want to slaughter Jawas,episode IV
LUKE,"If they traced the robots here, they may have learned who they sold them to.  And that would lead them back home",episode IV
BEN,"Wait, Luke  Its too dangerous.",episode IV
LUKE,Uncle Owen  Aunt Beru  Uncle Owen,episode IV
VADER,"And, now Your Highness, we will discuss the location of your hidden Rebel base.",episode IV
BEN,"Theres nothing you could have done, Luke, had you been there.  Youd have been killed, too, and the droids would now be in the hands of the Empire.",episode IV
LUKE,I want to come with you to Alderaan.  Theres nothing here for me now.  I want to learn the ways of the Force and become a Jedi like my father.,episode IV
BEN,Mos Eisley Spaceport.  You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy.  We must be cautious.,episode IV

TROOPER,Move along.  Move along.,episode IV
THREEPIO,I cant abide these Jawas.  Disgusting creatures.,episode IV
LUKE,"Go on, go on.  I cant understand how we got by those troopers.  I thought we were dead.",episode IV
BEN,The Force can have a strong influence on the weak-minded.  You will find it a powerful ally.,episode IV
LUKE,Do you really think were going to find a pilot here thatll take us to Alderaan,episode IV
BEN,"Well, most of the best freighter pilots can be found here.  Only watch your step.  This place can be a little rough.",episode IV
LUKE,Im ready for anything.,episode IV
THREEPIO,"Come along, Artoo.",episode IV
BARTENDER,We dont serve their kind here,episode IV
LUKE,What,episode IV
BARTENDER,Your droids. Theyll have to wait outside.  We dont want them here.,episode IV
LUKE,"Listen, why dont you wait out by the speeder.  We dont want any trouble.",episode IV
THREEPIO,I heartily agree with you sir.,episode IV
CREATURE,Negola dewaghi wooldugger,episode IV
HUMAN,He doesnt like you.,episode IV
LUKE,Im sorry.,episode IV

THREEPIO,I dont like the look of this.,episode IV
HAN,Han Solo.  Im captain of the Millennium Falcon.  Chewie here tells me youre looking for passage to the Alderaan system.,episode IV
BEN,"Yes, indeed.  If its a fast ship.",episode IV
HAN,Fast ship  Youve never heard of the Millennium Falcon,episode IV
BEN,Should I have,episode IV
HAN,Its the ship that made the Kessel run in less than twelve parsecs,episode IV
HAN,"Ive outrun Imperial starships, not the local bulk-cruisers, mind you.  Im talking about the big Corellian ships now.  Shes fast enough for you, old man.  Whats the cargo",episode IV
BEN,"Only passengers.  Myself, the boy, two droids, and no questions asked.",episode IV
HAN,What is it  Some kind of local trouble,episode IV
BEN,Lets just say wed like to avoid any Imperial entanglements.,episode IV
HAN,"Well, thats the real trick, isnt it  And its going to cost you something extra.  Ten thousand in advance.",episode IV
LUKE,Ten thousand  We could almost buy our own ship for that,episode IV
HAN,"But whos going to fly it, kid  You",episode IV
LUKE,You bet I could.  Im not such a bad pilot myself  We dont have to sit here and listen...,episode IV
BEN,"We havent that much with us.  But we could pay you two thousand now, plus fifteen when we reach Alderaan.",episode IV
HAN,"Seventeen, huh",episode IV
HAN,Okay.  You guys got yourself a ship.  Well leave as soon as youre ready.  Docking bay Ninety-four.,episode IV
BEN,Ninety-four.,episode IV
HAN,Looks like somebodys beginning to take an interest in your handiwork.,episode IV
TROOPER,"All right, well check it out.",episode IV
HAN,Seventeen thousand  Those guys must really be desperate.  This could really save my neck.  Get back to the ship and get her ready.,episode IV
BEN,Youll have to sell your speeder.,episode IV
LUKE,Thats okay.  Im never coming back to this planet again.,episode IV
GREEDO,"Going somewhere, Solo",episode IV
HAN,"Yes, Greedo.  As a matter of fact, I was just going to see your boss.  Tell Jabba that Ive got his money.",episode IV
GREEDO,"Its too late.  You should have paid him when you had the chance.  Jabbas put a price on your head, so large that every bounty hunter in the galaxy will be looking for you.  Im lucky I found you first.",episode IV
HAN,"Yeah, but this time I got the money.",episode IV
GREEDO,"If you give it to me, I might forget I found you.",episode IV
HAN,I dont have it with me.  Tell Jabba...,episode IV
GREEDO,Jabbas through with you.  He has no time for smugglers who drop their shipments at the first sign of an Imperial cruiser.,episode IV
HAN,Even I get boarded sometimes.  Do you think I had a choice,episode IV
GREEDO,You can tell that to Jabba.  He may only take your ship.,episode IV
HAN,Over my dead body.,episode IV
GREEDO,Thats the idea Ive been looking forward to killing you for a long time.,episode IV
HAN,"Yes, Ill bet you have.",episode IV
HAN,Sorry about the mess.,episode IV
VADER,Her resistance to the mind probe is considerable.  It will be some time before we can extract any information from her.,episode IV
IMPERIAL OFFICER,The final check-out is complete.  All systems are operational.  What course shall we set,episode IV
TARKIN,Perhaps she would respond to an alternative form of persuasion.,episode IV
VADER,What do you mean,episode IV
TARKIN,I think it is time we demonstrate the full power of this station.Set your course for Princess Leias home planet of Alderaan.,episode IV
TROOPER,With pleasure.,episode IV
THREEPIO,"Lock the door, Artoo.",episode IV
TROOPER,"All right, check that side of the street.  Its secure.  Move on to the next door.",episode IV
THREEPIO,"I would much rather have gone with Master Luke than stay here with you.  I dont know what all this trouble is about, but Im sure it must be your fault.",episode IV
THREEPIO,You watch your language,episode IV
LUKE,"He says its the best he can do.  Since the XP-38 came out, they ",episode IV
BEN,It will be enough.,episode IV
BEN,"If the ships as fast as hes boasting, we ought to do well.",episode IV
JABBA,"Come on out, Solo",episode IV
HAN,"Ive been waiting for you, Jabba.",episode IV
JABBA,I expected you would be.,episode IV
HAN,Im not the type to run.,episode IV
JABBA,"Han, my boy, there are times when you disappoint me... why havent you paid me  And why did you have to fry poor Greedo like that... after all weve been through together.",episode IV
HAN,You sent Greedo to blast me.,episode IV
JABBA,"Han, why youre the best smuggler in the business.  Youre too valuable to fry.  He was only relaying my concern at your delays.  He wasnt going to blast you.",episode IV
HAN,"I think he thought he was.  Next time dont send one of those twerps.  If youve got something to say to me, come see me yourself.",episode IV
JABBA,"Han, Han  If only you hadnt had to dump that shipment of spice... you understand I just cant make an exception.  Where would I be if every pilot who smuggled for me dumped their shipment at the first sign of an Imperial starship  Its not good business.",episode IV
HAN,"You know, even I get boarded sometimes, Jabba.  I had no choice, but Ive gota charter now and I can pay you back, plus a little extra.  I just need some more time.",episode IV
JABBA,"Put your blasters away.  Han, my boy, Im only doing this because youre the best and I need you.  So, for an extra, say... twenty percent Ill give you a little more time... but this is it.  If you disappoint me again, Ill put a price on your head so large you wont be able to go near a civilized system for the rest of your short life.",episode IV
HAN,"Jabba, Ill pay you because its my pleasure.",episode IV
LUKE,What a piece of junk.,episode IV
HAN,"Shell make point five beyond the speed of light.  She may not look like much, but shes got it where it counts, kid.  Ive added some special modifications myself.",episode IV
HAN,"Were a little rushed, so if youll hurry aboard well get out of here.",episode IV
THREEPIO,"Hello, sir.",episode IV
TROOPER,Which way,episode IV
TROOPER,"All right, men.  Load your weapons",episode IV
TROOPER,Stop that ship,episode IV
TROOPER,Blast em,episode IV
HAN,"Chewie, get us out of here",episode IV
THREEPIO,"Oh, my.  Id forgotten how much I hate space travel.",episode IV
HAN,It looks like an Imperial cruiser.  Our passengers must be hotter than I thought.  Try and hold them off.  Angle the deflector shield while I make the calculations for the jump to light speed.,episode IV
HAN,Stay sharp  There are two more coming in theyre going to try to cut us off.,episode IV
LUKE,Why dont you outrun them  I thought you said this thing was fast.,episode IV
HAN,"Watch your mouth, kid, or youre going to find yourself floating home.  Well be safe enough once we make the jump to hyperspace.  Besides, I know a few maneuvers. Well lose them",episode IV
HAN,Heres where the fun begins,episode IV
BEN,How long before you can make the jump to light speed,episode IV
HAN,Itll take a few moments to get the coordinates from the navi-computer.,episode IV
LUKE,Are you kidding  At the rate theyre gaining...,episode IV
HAN,"Traveling through hyperspace isnt like dusting crops, boy  Without precise calculations we could fly right through a star or bounce too close to a supernova and thatd end your trip real quick, wouldnt it",episode IV
LUKE,Whats that flashing,episode IV
HAN,"Were losing our deflector shield.  Go strap yourself in, Im going to make the jump to light speed.",episode IV
MOTTI,Weve entered the Alderaan system.,episode IV
LEIA,"Governor Tarkin, I should have expected to find you holding Vaders leash.  I recognized your foul stench when I was brought on board.",episode IV
TARKIN,Charming to the last.  You dont know how hard I found it signing the order to terminate your life,episode IV
LEIA,to take the responsibility yourself,episode IV
TARKIN,"Princess Leia, before your execution I would like you to be my guest at a ceremony that will make this battle station operational.  No star system will dare oppose the Emperor now.",episode IV
LEIA,"The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers.",episode IV
TARKIN,"Not after we demonstrate the power of this station.  In a way, you have determined the choice of the planet thatll be destroyed first.  Since you are reluctant to provide us with the location of the Rebel base, I have chosen to test this stations destructive power... on your home planet of Alderaan.",episode IV
LEIA,No  Alderaan is peaceful.  We have no weapons.  You cant possibly...,episode IV
TARKIN,You would prefer another target  A military target  Then name the system,episode IV
TARKIN,I grow tired of asking this.  So itll be the last time.  Where is the Rebel base,episode IV
LEIA,Dantooine.,episode IV
LEIA,Theyre on Dantooine.,episode IV
TARKIN,"There.  You see Lord Vader, she can be reasonable. Continue with the operation.  You may fire when ready.",episode IV
LEIA,What,episode IV
TARKIN,Youre far too trusting.  Dantooine is too remote to make an effective demonstration.  But dont worry.  We will deal with your Rebel friends soon enough. ,episode IV
LEIA,No,episode IV
VADER,Commence primary ignition.,episode IV
LUKE,Are you all right  Whats wrong,episode IV
BEN,I felt a great disturbance in the Force... as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced.  I fear something terrible has happened.,episode IV
BEN,Youd better get on with your exercises.,episode IV
HAN,"Well, you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs.  I told you Id outrun em.",episode IV
HAN,Dont everyone thank me at once.,episode IV
HAN,"Anyway, we should be at Alderaan about oh-two-hundred hours.",episode IV
THREEPIO,"Now be careful, Artoo.",episode IV
THREEPIO,He made a fair move.  Screaming about it wont help you.,episode IV
HAN,Let him have it. Its not wise to upset a Wookiee.,episode IV
THREEPIO,"But sir, nobody worries about upsetting a droid.",episode IV
HAN,Thats cause droids dont pull peoples arms out of their socket when they lose.  Wookiees are known to do that.,episode IV
THREEPIO,"I see your point, sir.  I suggest a new strategy, Artoo.  Let the Wookiee win.",episode IV
BEN,"Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him.",episode IV
LUKE,You mean it controls your actions,episode IV
BEN,Partially. But it also obeys your commands.,episode IV
HAN,"Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid.",episode IV
LUKE,"You dont believe in the Force, do you",episode IV
HAN,"Kid, Ive flown from one side of this galaxy to the other.  Ive seen a lot of strange stuff, but Ive never seen anything to make me believe theres one all-powerful force controlling everything.  Theres no mystical energy field that controls my destiny.",episode IV
HAN,Its all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.,episode IV
BEN,"I suggest you try it again, Luke.",episode IV
BEN,"This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct.",episode IV
LUKE,"With the blast shield down, I cant even see.  How am I supposed to fight",episode IV
BEN,Your eyes can deceive you.  Dont trust them.,episode IV
BEN,Stretch out with your feelings.,episode IV
BEN,"You see, you can do it.",episode IV
HAN,I call it luck. ,episode IV
BEN,"In my experience, theres no such thing as luck.",episode IV
HAN,"Look, going good against remotes is one thing.  Going good against the living  Thats something else.",episode IV
HAN,Looks like were coming up on Alderaan.,episode IV
LUKE,"You know, I did feel something.  I could almost see the remote.",episode IV
BEN,Thats good.  You have taken your first step into a larger world.,episode IV
TARKIN,Yes.,episode IV
OFFICER CASS,"Our scout ships have reached Dantooine.  They found the remains of a Rebel base, but they estimate that it has been deserted for some time.  They are now conducting an extensive search of the surrounding systems.",episode IV
TARKIN,She lied  She lied to us,episode IV
VADER,I told you she would never consciously betray the Rebellion.,episode IV
TARKIN,Terminate her... immediately,episode IV
HAN,"Stand by, Chewie, here we go.  Cut in the sublight engines.",episode IV
HAN,"What the...  Aw, weve come out of hyperspace into a meteor shower.  Some kind of asteroid collision.  Its not on any of the charts.",episode IV
LUKE,Whats going on,episode IV
HAN,"Our position is correct, except... no, Alderaan",episode IV
LUKE,What do you mean  Where is it,episode IV
HAN,"Thats what Im trying to tell you, kid.  It aint there.  Its been totally blown away.",episode IV
LUKE,What  How,episode IV
BEN,Destroyed... by the Empire,episode IV
HAN,The entire starfleet couldnt destroy the whole planet.  Itd take a thousand ships with more fire power than Ive...,episode IV
HAN,Theres another ship coming in.,episode IV
LUKE,Maybe they know what happened.,episode IV
BEN,Its an Imperial fighter.,episode IV
LUKE,It followed us,episode IV
BEN,No.  Its a short range fighter.,episode IV
HAN,There arent any bases around here.  Where did it come from,episode IV
LUKE,"It sure is leaving in a big hurry.  If they identify us, were in big trouble.",episode IV
HAN,Not if I can help it.  Chewie... jam its transmissions.,episode IV
BEN,Itd be as well to let it go.  Its too far out of range.,episode IV
HAN,Not for long...,episode IV
BEN,A fighter that size couldnt get this deep into space on its own.,episode IV
LUKE,"Then he must have gotten lost, been part of a convoy or something...",episode IV
HAN,"Well, he aint going to be around long enough to tell anyone about us.",episode IV
LUKE,Look at him.  Hes heading for that small moon.,episode IV
HAN,I think I can get him before he gets there... hes almost in range.,episode IV
BEN,Thats no moon  Its a space station.,episode IV
HAN,Its too big to be a space station.,episode IV
LUKE,I have a very bad feeling about this.,episode IV
BEN,Turn the ship around,episode IV
HAN,"Yeah, I think your right.  Full reverse  Chewie, lock in the auxiliary power.",episode IV
LUKE,Why are we still moving towards it,episode IV
HAN,Were caught in a tractor beam  Its pulling us in,episode IV
LUKE,But theres gotta be something you can do,episode IV
HAN,"Theres nothin I can do about it, kid.  Im in full power.  Im going to have to shut down.  But theyre not going to get me without a fight",episode IV
BEN,You cant win.  But there are alternatives to fighting.,episode IV

OFFICER,To your stations,episode IV
OFFICER,Come with me.,episode IV
OFFICER,Close all outboard shields  Close all outboard shields,episode IV
TARKIN,Yes.,episode IV
VOICE,Weve captured a freighter entering the remains of the Alderaan system.  Its markings match those of a ship that blasted its way out of Mos Eisley.,episode IV
VADER,They must be trying to return the stolen plans to the princess.  She may yet be of some use to us.,episode IV
VOICE,Unlock one-five-seven and nine. Release charges.,episode IV
OFFICER,"Theres no one on board, sir.  According to the log, the crew abandoned ship right after takeoff.  It must be a decoy, sir.  Several of the escape pods have been jettisoned.",episode IV
VADER,Did you find any droids,episode IV
OFFICER,"No, sir.  If there were any on board, they must also have jettisoned.",episode IV
VADER,Send a scanning crew on board.  I want every part of this ship checked.,episode IV
OFFICER,"Yes, sir.",episode IV
VADER,I sense something... a presence I havent felt since...,episode IV
OFFICER,Get me a scanning crew in here on the double.  I want every part of this ship checked,episode IV
LUKE,"Boy, its lucky you had these compartments.",episode IV
HAN,"I use them for smuggling.  I never thought Id be smuggling myself in them.  This is ridiculous.  Even if I could take off, Id never get past the tractor beam.",episode IV
BEN,Leave that to me,episode IV
HAN,Damn fool. I knew that you were going to say that,episode IV
BEN,Whos the more foolish... the fool or the fool who follows him,episode IV
TROOPER,"The ships all yours.  If the scanners pick up anything, report it immediately.  All right, lets go.",episode IV
HAN,"Hey down there, could you give us a hand with this",episode IV
GANTRY OFFICER,"TX-four-one-two.  Why arent you at your post  TX-four-one-two, do you copy ",episode IV
GANTRY OFFICER,Take over.  Weve got a bad transmitter.  Ill see what I can do.,episode IV
LUKE,"You know, between his howling and your blasting everything in sight, its a wonder the whole station doesnt know were here.",episode IV
HAN,Bring them on  I prefer a straight fight to all this sneaking around.,episode IV
THREEPIO,"We found the computer outlet, sir.",episode IV
BEN,Plug in.  He should be able to interpret the entire Imperial computer network.,episode IV
THREEPIO,He says hes found the main control to the power beam thats holding the ship here.  Hell try to make the precise location appear on the monitor.,episode IV
THREEPIO,The tractor beam is coupled to the main reactor in seven locations.  A power loss at one of the terminals will allow the ship to leave.,episode IV
BEN,I dont think you boys can help.  I must go alone.,episode IV
HAN,Whatever you say.  Ive done more than I bargained for on this trip already.,episode IV
LUKE,I want to go with you.,episode IV
BEN,"Be patient, Luke.  Stay and watch over the droids.",episode IV
LUKE,But he can...,episode IV
BEN,They must be delivered safely or other star systems will suffer the same fate as Alderaan.  Your destiny lies along a different path from mine.  The Force will be with you... always,episode IV
HAN,"Boy you said it, Chewie.",episode IV
HAN,Where did you dig up that old fossil,episode IV
LUKE,Ben is a great man.,episode IV
HAN,"Yeah, great at getting us into trouble.",episode IV
LUKE,I didnt hear you give any ideas...,episode IV
HAN,"Well, anything would be better than just hanging around waiting for them to pick us up...",episode IV
LUKE,Who do you think...,episode IV
LUKE,What is it,episode IV
THREEPIO,"Im afraid Im not quite sure, sir. He says I found her, and keepsrepeating, Shes found here.",episode IV

HAN,What are you talking about,episode IV
LUKE,The droid belongs to her.  Shes the one in the message.  Weve got to help her.,episode IV
HAN,"Now, look, dont get any funny ideas.  The old man wants us to wait right here.",episode IV
LUKE,"But he didnt know she was here.  Look, will you just find a way back into the detention block",episode IV
HAN,Im not going anywhere.,episode IV
LUKE,"Theyre going to execute her.  Look, a few minutes ago you said you didnt want to just wait here to be captured.  Now all you want to do is stay. ",episode IV

HAN,"Dont worry, Chewie.  I think I know what he has in mind.",episode IV
THREEPIO,"Master Luke, sir  Pardon me for asking... but, ah... what should Artoo and I do if were discovered here",episode IV
LUKE,Lock the door,episode IV
HAN,And hope they dont have blasters.,episode IV
THREEPIO,That isnt very reassuring.,episode IV
LUKE,I cant see a thing in this helmet.,episode IV
HAN,This is not going to work.,episode IV
LUKE,Why didnt you say so before,episode IV
HAN,I did say so before,episode IV
OFFICER,Where are you taking this... thing,episode IV

DEATH STAR INTERCOM VOICE,We are approaching the planet Yavin.  The Rebel base is on a moon on the far side.  We are preparing to orbit the planet.,episode IV
DODONNA,The battle station is heavily shielded and carries a firepower greater than half the star fleet.Its defenses are designed around a direct large-scale assault.  A small one-man fighter should be able to penetrate the outer defense.,episode IV
GOLD LEADER,"Pardon me for asking, sir, but what good are snub fighters going to be against that",episode IV
DODONNA,"Well, the Empire doesnt consider a small one-man fighter to be any threat, or theyd have a tighter defense.  An analysis of the plans provided by Princess Leia has demonstrated a weakness in the battle station.",episode IV
DODONNA,"The approach will not be easy.  You are required to maneuver straight down this trench and skim the surface to this point.  The target area is only two meters wide.  Its a small thermal exhaust port, right below the main port.  The shaft leads directly to the reactor system.  A precise hit will start a chain reaction which should destroy the station.",episode IV
DODONNA,"Only a precise hit will set up a chain reaction.  The shaft is ray-shielded, so youll have to use proton torpedoes.",episode IV

LUKE,"Come on  Why dont you take a look around  You know whats about to happen, what theyre up against.  They could use a good pilot like you.  Youre turning your back on them.",episode IV
HAN,"What goods a reward if you aint around to use it  Besides, attacking that battle station aintmy idea of courage.  Its more like suicide.",episode IV
LUKE,"All right.  Well, take care of yourself, Han... guess thats what youre best at, isnt it",episode IV
HAN,"Hey, Luke... may the Force be with you",episode IV

LUKE,"Stay here and watch after the camp, Artoo.",episode V
THREEPIO,"Oh, where is Artoo when I need him",episode V
THREEPIO,"Sir, I dont know where your ship learned to communicate,  but it has the most peculiar dialect. I believe, sir, it says that the power coupling on the negative axis has been polarized. Im afraid youll have to replace it.",episode V
HAN,"Well, of course Ill have to replace it.",episode V
HAN,Here And Chewie...,episode V
HAN,...I think wed better replace the negative power  coupling.,episode V
HAN,"Hey, Your Worship, Im only trying to help.",episode V
LEIA,Would you please stop calling me that,episode V

THREEPIO,"Oh, youre perfectly welcome, sir.",episode V
NEEDA,"...and that, Lord Vader, was the last time they  appeared in any of our scopes. Considering the amount of damage weve sustained, they must have been destroyed.",episode V
VADER,"No, Captain, theyre alive. I want every ship available to  sweep the asteroid field until they are found.",episode V
PIETT,Lord Vader.,episode V
VADER,"Yes, Admiral, what is it",episode V
PIETT,The Emperor commands you make contact with him.,episode V
VADER,Move the ship out of the asteroid field so that we can send a  clear transmission.,episode V
PIETT,"Yes, my lord.",episode V
VADER,"What is thy bidding, my master",episode V
EMPEROR,There is a great disturbance in the Force.,episode V
VADER,I have felt it.,episode V
EMPEROR,We have a new enemy -- Luke Skywalker.,episode V
VADER,"Yes, my master.",episode V
EMPEROR,He could destroy us.,episode V
VADER,Hes just a boy. Obi-Wan can no longer help him.,episode V
EMPEROR,The Force is strong with him. The son of Skywalker must not  become a Jedi.,episode V
VADER,"If he could be turned, he would become a powerful ally.",episode V

CREATURE,"Not far. Yoda not far. Patience. Soon you will be with him.   Rootleaf, I cook. Why wish you become Jedi Hm",episode V

YODA,"Ready, are you What know you of ready For eight hundred years  have I trained Jedi. My own counsel will I keep on who is to be trained A Jedi must have the deepest commitment, the most serious mind.  This one a long time have I watched. Never his mind on where he was. Hmm What he was doing. Hmph. Adventure. Heh Excitement. Heh A Jedi craves not these things.  You are reckless",episode V

LEIA,What,episode V
YODA,"Run Yes. A Jedis strength flows from the Force. But beware of  the dark side. Anger...fear...aggression. The dark side of the Force are they. Easily they flow, quick to join you in a fight.

LUKE,Vader. Is the dark side stronger,episode V
YODA,"No...no...no. Quicker, easier, more seductive.",episode V
LUKE,But how am I to know the good side from the bad,episode V
YODA,"You will know. When you are calm, at peace. Passive. A Jedi uses  the Force for knowledge and defense, never for attack.",episode V

LUKE,I cant. Its too big.,episode V
YODA,"Size matters not. Look at me. Judge me by my size, do you Hm  Mmmm.",episode V
YODA,"And well you should not. For my ally in the Force. And a  powerful ally it is. Life creates it, makes it grow. Its energy surrounds us and binds us.

HAN,Arent you afraid the Empires going to find out about this  little operation and shut you down,episode V
LANDO,Thats always been a danger looming like a shadow over  everything weve built here. But things have developed that will insure security. Ive just made a deal that will keep the Empire out of here forever.,episode V

LANDO,Lord Vader.,episode V
VADER,You may take Captain Solo to Jabba the Hut after I  have Skywalker.,episode V
BOBA FETT,Hes no good to me dead.,episode V
VADER,He will not be permanently damaged.,episode V
LANDO,"Lord Vader, what about Leia and the Wookiee",episode V
VADER,They must never again leave this city.,episode V

VADER,Perhaps you think youre being treated unfairly.,episode V

LANDO,"Stop Ive done all I can do. Im sorry I couldnt do better,  but I have my own problems.",episode V
HAN,"Yeah, youre a real hero.",episode V
LEIA,You certainly have a way with people.,episode V
VADER,"This facility is crude, but it should be adequate to freeze  Skywalker for his journey to the Emperor.",episode V
IMPERIAL SOLDIER,"Lord Vader, ship approaching. X-wing class.",episode V
VADER,Good. Monitor Skywalker and allow him to land.,episode V
LANDO,"Lord Vader, we only use this facility for carbon freezing. If  you put him in there, it might kill him.",episode V
VADER,I do not want the Emperors prize damaged. We will test it...on  Captain Solo.,episode V
THREEPIO,"If only you had attached my legs, I wouldnt be in this  ridiculous position. Now, remember, Chewbacca, you have a responsibility to me, so dont do anything foolish.",episode V
HAN,Whats going on...buddy,episode V
LANDO,Youre being put into carbon freeze.,episode V
BOBA FETT,What if he doesnt survive Hes worth a lot to me.,episode V

VADER,"Well, Calrissian, did he survive",episode V
LANDO,"Yes, hes alive. And in perfect hibernation.",episode V
VADER,Hes all yours bounty hunter. Reset the chamber for Skywalker.,episode V
IMPERIAL OFFICER,"Skywalker has just landed, my lord.",episode V
VADER,"Good. See to it that he finds his way here. Calrissian, take  the princess and the Wookiee to my ship.",episode V
LANDO,You said theyd be left in the city under my supervision.,episode V
VADER,I am altering the deal. Pray I dont alter it any further.,episode V
LEIA,"Luke Luke, dont -- its a trap Its a trap",episode V
VADER,"The Force is with you, young Skywalker. But you are not a Jedi  yet.",episode V

HAN,"Good, I hate long waits.",episode VI
THREEPIO,"You will therefore be taken to the Dune Sea and cast into the pit of Carkoon, the nesting place of the all-powerful Sarlacc.",episode VI
HAN,Doesnt sound so bad.,episode VI
THREEPIO,"In his belly, you will find a new definition of pain and suffering, as you are slowly digested over a thousand years.",episode VI
HAN,"On second thought, lets pass on that, huh",episode VI
LUKE,"You should have bargained, Jabba. Thats the last mistake youll ever make.",episode VI
HAN,"I think my eyes are getting better. Instead of a big dark blur, I see a big light blur.",episode VI
LUKE,"Theres nothing to see. I used to live here, you know.",episode VI
HAN,"Youre gonna die here, you know. Convenient.",episode VI
LUKE,Just stick close to Chewie and Lando. Ive taken care of everything.,episode VI
HAN,Oh... great,episode VI
JABBA,Soon you will learn to appreciate me.,episode VI
THREEPIO,"Oh, Im terribly sor... Artoo What are you doing here",episode VI
THREEPIO,"Well, I can see youre serving drinks, but this place is dangerous. Theyre going to execute Master Luke and, if were not careful, us too",episode VI
THREEPIO,Hmm.  I wish I had your confidence.,episode VI
THREEPIO,"Victims of the almighty Sarlacc: His Excellency hopes that you will die honorably. But should any of you wish to beg for mercy, the great Jabba the Hutt will now listen to your pleas.",episode VI
HAN,"Threepio, you tell that slimy piece of... worm-ridden filth hell get no such pleasure from us. Right",episode VI
LUKE,Jabba This is your last chance. Free us or die.,episode VI
JABBA,Move him into position.,episode VI

LUKE,Lets go And dont forget the droids.,episode VI
LANDO,Were on our way.,episode VI

HAN,Then I guess Im getting better.,episode VI
HAN,"Ive got to hand it to you, kid, you were pretty good out there.",episode VI
LUKE,I had a lot of help. Think nothing of it.,episode VI
HAN,"No, Im thinking a lot about it. That carbon freeze was the closest thing to dead there is. And it wasnt just sleepin. It was a big wide awake nothing",episode VI
LUKE,Ill see you back at the fleet.,episode VI
HAN,Why dont you leave that crate and come with us,episode VI
LUKE,I have a promise I have to keep first... to an old friend.,episode VI
HAN,"Guess I owe you some thanks, too, Lando.",episode VI
LANDO,"Figured if I left you frozen like that youd just give me bad luck the rest of my life, so I might as well get you unfrozen sooner or later.",episode VI
LEIA,He means Youre welcome.,episode VI
LANDO,"Come on, lets get off this miserable dust ball.",episode VI
LUKE,Ill meet you back at the fleet.,episode VI
LEIA,Hurry. The Alliance should be assembled by now.,episode VI
LUKE,I will.,episode VI
HAN,"Hey, Luke, thanks. Thanks for comin after me. Now I owe you one.",episode VI
LUKE,"Thats right, Artoo. Were going to the  Dagobah system. I have a promise to keep...  to an old friend.",episode VI
EMPEROR,"Rise, my friend.",episode VI
VADER,The Death Star will be completed on schedule.,episode VI
EMPEROR,"You have done well, Lord Vader. And now I sense you wish to continue your search for young Skywalker.",episode VI
VADER,"Yes, my Master.",episode VI
EMPEROR,"Patience, my friend. In time he will seek you out. And when he does, you must bring him before me. He has grown strong. Only together can we turn him to the dark side of the Force.",episode VI
VADER,As you wish.,episode VI
EMPEROR,Everything is proceeding as I have foreseen.,episode VI
YODA,Hmm. That face you make. Look I so old to young eyes,episode VI
LUKE,No... of course not.,episode VI
YODA,"I do, yes, I do  Sick have I become. Old and weak.  When nine hundred years old you reach, look as good you will not. Hmm",episode VI
YODA,"Soon will I rest. Yes, forever sleep. Earned it, I have.",episode VI
LUKE,"Master Yoda, you cant die.",episode VI
YODA,Strong am I with the Force... but not that strong Twilight is upon me and soon night must fall. That is the way of things ... the way of the Force.,episode VI
LUKE,But I need your help. Ive come back to complete the training.,episode VI
YODA,No more training do you require. Already know you that which you need.,episode VI
LUKE,Then I am a Jedi,episode VI
YODA,"Ohhh. Not yet. One thing remains: Vader. You must confront Vader. Then, only then, a Jedi will you be. And confront him you will.",episode VI
LUKE,Master Yoda... is Darth Vader my father,episode VI
YODA,Mmm... rest I need. Yes... rest.,episode VI
LUKE,"Yoda, I must know.",episode VI
YODA,Your father he is.,episode VI
YODA,"Told you, did he",episode VI
LUKE,Yes.,episode VI
YODA,"Unexpected this is, and unfortunate..",episode VI
LUKE,Unfortunate that I know the truth,episode VI
YODA,No. Unfortunate that you rushed to face him... that incomplete was your training. Not ready for the burden were you.,episode VI
LUKE,"Well, Im sorry.",episode VI
YODA,"Remember, a Jedis strength flows from the Force.  But beware.  Anger, fear, aggression. The dark side are they.  Once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny.",episode VI
YODA,"Luke...Luke...Do not...Do not underestimate the powers of the Emperor, or suffer your fathers fate, you will. Luke, when gone am I , the last of the Jedi will you be. Luke, the Force runs strong in your family. Pass on what you have learned, Luke...  There is... another...Sky...Sky...walker.",episode VI
LUKE,"I cant do it, Artoo. I cant go on alone.",episode VI
BEN,Yoda will always be with you.,episode VI
LUKE,Obi-Wan Why didnt you tell me,episode VI
LUKE,You told me Vader betrayed and murdered my father.,episode VI
BEN,"You father was seduced by the dark side of the Force. He ceased to be Anakin Skywalker and became Darth Vader. When that happened, the good man who was your father was destroyed. So what I have told you was true... from a certain point of view.",episode VI
LUKE,A certain point of view,episode VI
BEN,"Luke, youre going to find that many of the truths we cling to depend greatly on our own point of view.",episode VI
BEN,"I dont blame you for being angry. If I was wrong in what I did, it certainly wouldnt have been for the first time. You see, what happened to your father was my fault.",episode VI
BEN,Anakin was a good friend.,episode VI
BEN,"When I first knew him, your father was already a great pilot. But I was amazed how strongly the Force was with him.  I took it upon myself to train him as a Jedi.  I thought that I could instruct him just as well as Yoda.  I was wrong.  My pride has had terrible consequences for the galaxy.",episode VI
LUKE,Theres still good in him.,episode VI
BEN,I also thought he could be turned back to the good side. It couldnt be done. He is more machine now than man. Twisted and evil.,episode VI
LUKE,"I cant do it, Ben.",episode VI
BEN,You cannot escape your destiny.,episode VI
LUKE,I tried to stop him once. I couldnt do it.,episode VI
BEN,"Vader humbled you when first you met him, Luke...but that experience was part of your training. It taught you, among other things, the value of patience.  Had you not been so impatient to defeat Vader then, you could have finished your training here with Yoda. You would have been prepared.",episode VI
LUKE,But I had to help my friends.,episode VI
BEN,"And did you help them It was they who had to save you. You achieved little by rushing back prematurely, I fear.",episode VI
LUKE,I found out Darth Vader was my father.,episode VI
BEN,"To be a Jedi, Luke, you must confront and then go beyond the dark side - the side your father couldnt get past. Impatience is the easiest door - for you, like your father. Only, your father was seduced by what he found on the other side of the door, and you have held firm. Youre no longer so reckless now, Luke. You are strong and patient. And now, you must face Darth Vader again",episode VI
LUKE,I cant kill my own father.,episode VI
BEN,Then the Emperor has already won. You were our only hope.,episode VI
LUKE,Yoda spoke of another.,episode VI
BEN,The other he spoke of is your twin sister.,episode VI
LUKE,But I have no sister.,episode VI
BEN,"Hmm. To protect you both from the Emperor, you were hidden from your father when you were born. The Emperor knew, as I did, if Anakin were to have any offspring, they would be a threat to him. That is the reason why your sister remains safely anonymous.",episode VI
LUKE,Leia Leias my sister.,episode VI
BEN,"Your insight serves you well. Bury your feelings deep down, Luke. They do you credit. But they could be made to serve the Emperor.",episode VI
BEN,"When your father left, he didnt know your mother was pregnant. Your mother and I knew he would find out eventually, but we wanted to keep you both as safe as possible, for as long as possible.  So I took you to live with my brother Owen on Tatooine... and your mother took Leia to live as the daughter of Senator Organa, on Alderaan.",episode VI
BEN,"The Organa household was high-born and politically quite powerful in that system. Leia became a princess by virtue of lineage... no one knew shed been adopted, of course. But it was a title without real power, since Alderaan had long been a democracy.  Even so, the family continued to be politically powerful, and Leia, following in her foster fathers path, became a senator as well.  Thats not all she became, of course... she became the leader of her cell in the Alliance against the corrupt Empire. And because she had diplomatic immunity, she was a vital link for getting information to the Rebel cause.  Thats what she was doing when her path crossed yours... for her foster parents had always told her to contact me on Tatooine, if her troubles became desperate.",episode VI
LUKE,"But you cant let her get involved now, Ben. Vader will destroy her.",episode VI
BEN,"She hasnt been trained in the ways of the Jedi the way you have, Luke ... but the Force is strong with her, as it is with all of your family. There is no avoiding the battle. You must face and destroy Vader",episode VI
HAN,"Well, look at you, a general, huh",episode VI
LANDO,"Oh, well, someone must have told them about my little maneuver at the battle of Taanab.",episode VI
HAN,"Well, dont look at me, pal. I just said you were a fair pilot. I didnt know they were lookin for somebody to lead this crazy attack.",episode VI
LANDO,Im surprised they didnt ask you to do it.,episode VI
HAN,"Well, who says they didnt.  But I aint crazy. Youre the respectable one, remember",episode VI
MON MOTHMA,The Emperor has made a critical error and the time for our attack has come.,episode VI
MON MOTHMA,"The data brought to us by the Bothan spies pinpoints the exact location of the Emperors new battle station. We also know that the weapon systems of this Death Star are not yet operational. With the Imperial Fleet spread throughout the galaxy in a vain effort to engage us, it is relatively unprotected. But most important of all, weve learned that the Emperor himself is personally overseeing the final stages of the construction of this Death Star.",episode VI
MON MOTHMA,"Many Bothans died to bring us this information. Admiral Ackbar, please.",episode VI
ACKBAR,"You can see here the Death Star orbiting the forest Moon of Endor. Although the weapon systems on this Death Star are not yet operational, the Death Star does have a strong defense mechanism. It is protected by an energy shield, which is generated from the nearby forest Moon of Endor. The shield must be deactivated if any attack is to be attempted. Once the shield is down, our cruisers will create a perimeter, while the fighters fly into the superstructure and attempt to knock out the main reactor.",episode VI
ACKBAR,General Calrissian has volunteered to lead the fighter attack,episode VI
HAN,Good luck.,episode VI
HAN,Youre gonna need it.,episode VI
ACKBAR,General Madine.,episode VI
GENERAL MADINE,"We have stolen a small Imperial shuttle. Disguised as a cargo ship, and using a secret Imperial code, a strike team will land on the moon and deactivate the shield generator.",episode VI
THREEPIO,Sounds dangerous.,episode VI
LEIA,I wonder who they found to pull that off.,episode VI
GENERAL MADINE,"General Solo, is your strike team assembled",episode VI
HAN,"Uh, my teams ready. I dont have a command crew for the shuttle.",episode VI
HAN,"Well, its gonna be rough, pal. I didnt want to speak for you.",episode VI
HAN,Thats one.,episode VI
LEIA,"Uh, General... count me in.",episode VI
VOICE,"Im with you, too",episode VI
LEIA,What is it,episode VI
LUKE,Ask me again sometime.,episode VI
HAN,Luke.,episode VI
LUKE,"Hi, Han... Chewie.",episode VI
THREEPIO, Exciting is hardly the word I would,episode VI
HAN,Look. I want you to take her. I mean it. Take her. You need all the help you can get. Shes the fastest ship in the fleet.,episode VI
LANDO,"All right, old buddy. You know, I know what she means to you. Ill take good care of her. She-she wont get a scratch. All right",episode VI
HAN,Right. I got your promise now. Not a scratch.,episode VI
LANDO,"Look, would you get going, you pirate.",episode VI
LANDO,Good luck.,episode VI
HAN,"You, too.",episode VI
HAN,You got her warmed,episode VI
LUKE,"Yeah, shes comin up.",episode VI
HAN,"No. I dont think the Empire had Wookiees in mind when they designed her, Chewie.",episode VI
LEIA,"Hey, are you awake",episode VI
HAN,"Yeah, I just got a funny feeling. Like Im not gonna see her again.",episode VI
LEIA,"Come on, General, lets move.",episode VI
HAN,"Right. Chewie, lets see what this piece of junk can do. Ready, everybody",episode VI
LUKE,All set.,episode VI
THREEPIO,Here we go again.,episode VI
HAN,"All right, hang on.",episode VI
VADER,"What is thy bidding, my Master",episode VI
EMPEROR,Send the fleet to the far side of Endor. There it will stay until called for.,episode VI
VADER,What of the reports of the Rebel fleet massing near Sullust,episode VI
EMPEROR,"It is of no concern. Soon the Rebellion will be crushed and young Skywalker will be one of us Your work here is finished, my friend. Go out to the command ship and await my orders.",episode VI
VADER,"Yes, my Master.",episode VI
HAN,"If they dont go for this, were gonna have to get outta here pretty quick, Chewie.",episode VI
CONTROLLER,We have you on our screen now. Please identify.,episode VI
HAN,Shuttle Tydirium requesting deactivation of the deflector shield.,episode VI

HAN,Itll work. Itll work.,episode VI
LUKE,Vaders on that ship.,episode VI
HAN,"Now dont get jittery, Luke. There are a lot of command ships. Keep your distance though, Chewie, but dont look like youre trying to keep your distance.",episode VI

HAN,"Its your imagination, kid. Come on. Lets keep a little optimism here.",episode VI
VADER,Where is that shuttle going,episode VI

PIETT,Shall I hold them,episode VI
VADER,No. Leave them to me. I will deal with them myself.,episode VI
PIETT,"As you wish, my lord.  Carry on.",episode VI
HAN,"Theyre not goin for it, Chewie.",episode VI

HAN,Okay I told you it was gonna work. No problem.,episode VI
THREEPIO,"Oh, I told you it was dangerous here.",episode VI
LEIA,Shall we try and go around,episode VI
HAN,Itll take time. This whole partyll be for nothing if they see us.,episode VI

THREEPIO,"Hello, I think... I could be mistaken. Theyre using a very primitive dialect.  But I do believe they think I am some sort of god.",episode VI
HAN,"Well, why dont you use your divine influence and get us out of this",episode VI
THREEPIO,"I beg your pardon, General Solo, but that just wouldnt be proper.",episode VI

VADER,The Emperor has been expecting you.,episode VI

VADER,"So, you have accepted the truth.",episode VI
LUKE,"Ive accepted the truth that you were once Anakin Skywalker, my father.",episode VI
VADER,That name no longer has any meaning for me.,episode VI
LUKE,It is the name of your true self. Youve only forgotten. I know there is good in you. The Emperor hasnt driven it from you fully. That is why you couldnt destroy me. Thats why you wont bring me to your Emperor now.,episode VI

LUKE,I will not turn...and youll be forced to kill me.,episode VI
VADER,If that is your destiny.,episode VI
LUKE,"Search your feelings, father. You cant do this. I feel the conflict within you. Let go of your hate.",episode VI
VADER,"It is too late for me, son. The Emperor will show you the true nature of the Force. He is your master now.",episode VI
LUKE,Then my father is truly dead.,episode VI
LEIA,The main entrance to the control bunkers on the far side of that landing platform. This isnt gonna be easy.,episode VI
HAN,"Hey, dont worry. Chewie and me got into a lot of places more heavily guarded than this.",episode VI
LEIA,Whats he saying,episode VI
THREEPIO,He says theres a secret entrance on the other side of the ridge.,episode VI
LANDO,"Admiral, were in position. All fighters accounted for.",episode VI
ACKBAR,Proceed with the countdown. All groups assume attack coordinates.,episode VI
LANDO,"Dont worry, my friends are down there. Theyll have that shield down on time... or thisll be the shortest offensive of all time.",episode VI
ACKBAR,"All craft, prepare to jump to hyperspace on my mark.",episode VI
LANDO,All right. Stand by.,episode VI
HAN,"Back door, huh Good idea.",episode VI

HAN,Then well do it real quiet-like.,episode VI
THREEPIO,"Oh Oh, my. Uh, Princess Leia",episode VI
